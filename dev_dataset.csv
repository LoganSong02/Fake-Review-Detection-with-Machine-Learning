She's a little smaller than I thought, but it's not her fault.  She chews every single treat she gets.  I also love the fact that it is a little heavier than she is.  This is not a big deal for us, because it's a very small bag.  But I would definitely recommend it.  I've only been using it a few days and it's been great.

Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,1,"Twyla looks quite different than pictured.  In person, my overall impression of Twyla is that she is less cutesy and has more of an intense/forlorn presentation that is appropriate for a monster like her:  The Daughter of the Boogey Man.  Twyla is all moonlight and shadows - her main colorways are a waxy mint green and her favorite color burple (which according to her is blue mixed with purple).  Twyla's skin is a very light purple which gradually changes to smoky gray on her forearms and hands.  She has silvery smoke patterns that start at her ankles and reach up her calves.  Twyla has purply-pink eyes, frosty pink lips and cute little dimples at the edge of her mouth.  I love her bright mint green eyebrows and her long soft minty green hair with  burple streaks.  As others have mentioned, a fun thing about Twyla is that the whites of her eyes glow in the dark!  (I thought her hair might glow as well, but sadly, no.)

Twyla is a new character - she is 15, shy, and hides under ""normie"" kid's beds to catch bad dreams.  She has the best Monster High Pet yet:  a purple dust bunny named Dustin.  Twyla is one of the smaller scale MH dolls - the same size as Howleen Wolf.  She wears a blue and black elbow length blouse and a tiered black and mint mini skirt with purple net ruffles.  Her accessories are a mint green belt and bracelet, a purple and black handbag with a cobweb and purple and black heels.  Her best accessories are her silver earrings that are a silver Victorian style door knob and lock-set.  She comes with a doll stand, hair brush and diary.

I know a lot of collectors are excited about Twyla and the new 13 Wishes Doll line.  Twyla is a great original new character.  Monster High does not disappoint.",316,20,1,4

Electronics_5,5.0,0,So far I've tried networked with the internet and it works fine. The only downside is that it's very small. I bought the TRS-80A as a replacement for my older model. I'm very pleased. I bought this to replace a broken one I bought for my TV. I wanted something that had a built-in DVD player and could use a USB hub. I chose the TRS-80A because it's very portable. I have a Roku player and the TRS-80A is just about perfect. I'm sure it will last a long time. The cord is long enough for me to get on the couch and use it while playing games. I can also use the remote to turn the TV on and off with my Roku. It's not the best for long distance but I'm sure it will last a long time. I would highly recommend this product. My wife loves this mouse. She loves that it is small. She has her own usb mouse and it's so small that she can move it around without touching the mouse. It's easy to set up and she loves it.

Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,1,"Our son received this toy as a gift when he was born.  We were a little worried about putting toys in his crib, but soon got over that when we realized how well he reacted to Pooh and the music!  Yes, it is a little loud for a lullaby toy, but the volume has never seemed to bother him -- he sleeps right through it.  When he was still in the infant stage, we used the remote control constantly to restart Pooh from the comfort of our bed if our son hadn't fallen asleep yet.  It's great that the remote allows you to select your starting point: the toy comes with three ""stages"" of songs, moving from singing to just music to soft music and bird chirps.  We would replay the softest music when the baby was nearly asleep, the singing when he was still fussy and needed more distraction.  He is one year old now, and he has learned over time to turn it on and off (push the cloud on the pillow).  We know he's awake when Pooh starts singing!  Quite often he hasn't quite had enough sleep, and he turns Pooh on, curls up with his blanket, and goes back to sleep.  The little light under the cloud is a great bonus, since it gives the baby a little ""comfort light"" when Pooh starts to sing (the light fades out as the music softens).  Our son LOVES this toy -- we couldn't imagine bedtime without it!  ONLY drawback (and it's negligible)--he loves it SO much that we really go through the AA batteries!  All things considered, that's a pretty good ""problem"" to have.  We highly recommend this toy.",281,14,4,12

Books_5,2.0,1,"Watching a friend's vacation slides may be an agreeable way to spend an evening, but Laurie R. King tests readers' patience with the same technique when she sends Mary Russell and her husband, Sherlock Holmes, to ""The Moor.""

The title refers to Dartmoor, nearly 400 square miles of fields, hills and treacherous marshes in the southwest of England. Conan Doyle set ""The Hound of the Baskervilles"" there, and King uses a rumored reappearance of the hound as the pretext for drawing her sleuthing couple there. They're summoned by the eccentric clergyman, author and hymn writer (""Onward Christian Soldiers"") Sabine Baring-Gould, now nearly 90 and in failing health.

But before the inquiry gets underway, we're given a long dissertation from Mrs. Holmes about Baring-Gould and Dartmoor. Between the suspicious death of a local who wandered off the straight and familiar and the discovery of a body in the good minister's lake, there's nearly 200 pages of Russell reading Baring-Gould's books, Russell talking with the man and Russell riding about the countryside and chatting up the locals. Getting to the heart of the hound mystery takes up the last hundred pages, with remarkably little of the suspense which the novel advertises.",199,10,0,1

Complex people facing their demons and working to overcome them. Jason has baggage that has followed him into adulthood.

I will say that I normally read only sci-fi/fantasy and had long ago grown  weary of these type of books.

Electronics_5,4.0,1,"UPDATE #2: As promised, the vendor sent a replacement headset, which does seem to work better. I was also surprised to find this one fits better too as I did NOT expect that. The original headset seems to be too springy (not really a great way to describe it, but the best words I can come up with at the moment), so it is constantly pulling at my ears and coming loose even with slight movement. This one seems to a little loser, so it is more forgiving of head movement. SO, headset #2 seems to have addressed my two biggest complaints about the headset, so I am happy to upgrade the rating to 4 stars instead of the original 1 star rate. Kudos to Patozon for taking the time to make things right!

UPDATE: The vendor has reached out to me after this review and they are sending me a replacement headset which I think is awesome. I have bumped this up to a two stat based on the customer service. Once I get the headset, assuming there is improvement in their performance, maybe I can bump it up even higher.

I am surprised this headset is so highly rated. I find them to not fit very well and they are constantly falling out of my ears even with the proper ear piece size. That alone would not justify the 1 star rating, but combined with the low sound quality and awful Bluetooth connection, this headset is a huge disappointment. Using a Samsung Galaxy S6, any audio streamed to this device is choppy, in many cases beyond comprehension, unless the phone is about 2 inches from the heaset; even then, sometimes it still doesn't work. I do not have this same issue with other Bluetooth devices paired to this phone. Given the primary function of a headset is to play audio and the fact that this headset doesn't seem to be able to do so warrants a 1 star rating. Wish I knew why some many others have a different experience with this product.",345,16,1,17

Solease has always kept our attention with each of the draglen brothers each story is always different, and each characters posses their own unique characteristics and dispositions in the book.

Shalisi is not your typical woman, though she is sweet, sexy there is one tiny problem in this possible romance... she is a witch and one of the dragons most mortal enemy. Her destiny is to become a Passer but she must make a difficult decision whether to leave her coven and true calling behind or to be with the dragon who makes her feel, and long for more.

I guess THEY didn't grow up watching this kind of stuff and don't  have those fond memories (which explains the 4 stars).

So Zapped! was just about the coolest naughty movie I'd ever seen.  Watching it now is still a delight!  Just silly non-sense...but awfully fun!  The young lady from The Facts of Life tv show is great (and looks like my niece).  Baio may be a little TOO nerdy, but he and Aames are believable friends.

And the there was Pierce, so handsome and aloof, but only at first glance, cause he is the one initiating the spark between Griff and him, and once fire took place, it's hot. The sex scenes, when happening, were at the same time erotic but classy, perfectly in character with the protagonists, and again, the setting.

I often say that, but I have to say it again, once you read a novel by Josh Lanyon you have the best of two worlds, the romance and the mystery/thriller.",203,6,0,13

Electronics_5,3.0,1,"I had originally posted a pretty scathing review because of my dissatisfaction with this product. Kooltek promptly contacted me both by replaying here and by e-mail, and offered me a full refund and said that I could keep the cooler. I promised that if I kept it, I would try the product again on another computer I have that is an exact duplicate of the one I first installed it on.

I just got time to do that this weekend, so here is my revised review.

Pros - Cooler installs fairly easily with no modifications to the motherboard. Fan has a cool blue LED.

Cons - Performance is mediocre. I'm not sure it cools any better than my stock cooler, but it does so quieter since it uses a 120 mm fan running at less than half the speed of the small fan on the stock cooler.

I'm using this on an ASUS motherboard with an AM3+ socket. Unlike some coolers, I didn't have to chance the mount and backing plate to install this one. But the mount is cumbersome, requiring you to get fingers down into spots that can be tight to push down on the spring clips.

I wonder if the heat sink compound that came with the cooler is of good quality? I had terrible results with the first installation when I used it, but on the second installation I used some compound that I had purchased awhile back. It seems of better quality.

It does seem to be performing better than the first time, but not as well as I would have hoped. Another cooler I paid only $10 more for dramatically outperforms this one, though it is much harder to install, requiring removing and replacing the mount and backing plate.

I think this cooler needs further refinement to be a viable product. For now, I recommend paying $10 ore and going with a better product.

But kudos to Kooltek for standing behind their product and going the extra mile to make me happy. That went a long way with me.",345,20,0,27

I picked it up because I thought it was some sort of crime novel and then it turned out to be about people - not my usual bag at all.

But I kept reading. It kept me up a few nights, just waiting for the shoe to drop.

And I realized I did like some of the characters. They were all broken in some way and I kind of warmed to them.

And when the shoe dropped I was pleased. And very happy I'd read it.

Trouble finished their European tour and Katie and Tyler talked all the time and skyped every night. Now that they are back together again and more in love, things are going to take work and nothing worth anything will be easy. More secrets are revealed and they both have to live with mistakes they made and things that happened.

Katie hasn't always been Ms. Responsible or Ms. Perfect. She's lived her life and made some mistakes but she's never done anything intentionally to hurt anyone. She has a good heart and she cares about the people in her life. Her love for Tyler is all encompassing and she just wants to make him happy.

Tyler has a really screwed up past and he's had problems for years of trying to get past it all. He's done so many drugs and almost died on many occasions. But his love for Katie makes him want to be clean and have a life with her. He's trying to find a way to work where his problems with his hands don't interfere.

Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,1,"The stainless steel is easy to disassemble and clean; it does not absorb bacteria like plastics.  I chose this one because stainless steel is healthier than plastics, and it looks better in my kitchen - like a sculptured water fountain.

After running it for the first time, after a few rotations of water, any residual rubber or machine smells will be gone, as the first reviewer/most helpful reviewer mentioned.

Simple Maintenance is key:

If the motor and pump are disassembled and cleaned properly, you won't need to replace them; you'll only need to replace filters, which are reasonably priced and well worth it.
If you don't clean the motor and  pump well enough or often enough, you will have to purchase a new motor and pump from the Pioneer Pet website (at least they sell it separately, though it's pricey enough to make you think about getting a second fountain.  Maintenance is key to getting 5 star use of this product and keeping its economic value.)

My cat has allergies and urinary tract infection tendencies; water is so important for her to prevent these issues.  She drinks the most from this fountain, laying next to it and sopping it up for minutes, than she ever did from the 2 plastic ones we had before (and eventually stopped working).  This fountain has helped keep her healthy, she's so hydrated.

It's very quiet and will only get noisy if you let the water level fall below the motor's line.  The noisiness is a sound of the motor's slow death - keep that water filled.

Take care of this product (and it doesn't take much; there are easy instructions, even online videos), and your pet will love you for it.  We've had this fountain 2 years this spring. She looks at me with ""I love you"" after I gave it to her the first time, and after I clean it (every week the bowl @ 5 mins, every month all parts @20 mins).  We both love this fountain. 5 Stars.",337,18,0,10

Books_5,4.0,1,"Watermark: A Novel of the Middle Ages opens with the event of Auda's birth, her welcome to the world, and a glimpse of the superstition that she faces throughout her life. By the time Auda is grown, she has learned her father's craft and has learned to express herself clearly in her writing. Few of the people around her are literate, but Auda has fashioned a life for herself.

Between assisting in the papermaking, serving as a scribe, and hiding her albino features, Auda has learned to move around in her world. Despite the danger to her person, Auda is not one to trade freedom for safety or independence for marriage. Though with the spread of the Inquisition's power, Medieval Europe is fraught with danger for anyone who seems different - and Auda knows that she can never blend in.

When Auda obtains the job of scribe in the castle, she flourishes. Her skills and writing bring her the respect and appreciation of powerful women. But her writing and beliefs also bring danger and loss.

Watermark is a carefully crafted and fascinating work of historical fiction. It's a story of love, fear and superstition, and of the struggle to keep one's identity.

Books_5,4.0,1,"Several of the science fiction ""classics"" I have read recently have proven to be rather less than classic for me. However, War of the Worlds is not one of them. I found it to be enjoyable, interesting, with an ability to keep me interested and engaged.

I was surprised when I started the book that it is NOT like the Orson Wells version of radio and movie fame. This is set in England at the end of the 19th century. This definitely limits the defensive abilities of the Earthlings compared to the movie. It is also part of what makes it interesting, because the Martians react much differently than the movie version as well. They are slower, more definite in their movements, and more connected between landing spots. Also, there are only ten landing spots for the Martians, it seems, rather than the world-wide invasion of the movie version. In fact, one area that left me questioning was what the rest of the world was doing while this went on in southern England?

The sample section of the book ""The Map of the Sky"" should have been left out, in my opinion. It was pompous and self-important, and was not in any way enjoyable, nor did it succeed in making me want to read a book that obviously was merely a ""tag-along"" story with little interest of its own.

The writing style was excellent, fast-moving overall though not without some hefty explanation sections. Grammar, spelling, word use, all are what one would expect from a consummate professional. I held off reading this book for quite a while after I downloaded it, in the fear that it would be another disappointing ""classic"". It was nothing of the sort; it is an excellent book of early science fiction, and a very enjoyable read.",301,16,0,11
Home_and_Kitchen_5,3.0,1,"My wife is very particular about ""her things"", and when her tea kettle was starting to rust out, she hinted that she would like a new one for her birthday.  So I found this highly reviewed kettle on Amazon and thought it a good deal for many years of service.  When my wife received it for her birthday, she was not completely satisfied, but over the past two months she has ""gotten used to it"".  Here are her complaints:

1. Difficulty getting water into it.
  - with my wife's old kettle, she filled it through the spout.  The spout on this kettle is a bit narrower than her old one, so at first water would spill down the side and get the outside wet.  She also tried to use the filling lid on top, but the lid has tight tolerances (so steam doesn't escape or rattle around), and the handle doesn't move, so there is no clear path to the pot without getting the outside wet.

2. Difficulty eating water out of it.
  - as you can see from the picture, the spout protrudes from the upper quarter of the pot.  This means she has to hold the kettle at an almost 90 degree angle to pour her hot water, and dousing her hand with a good bit of hot steam.  With filling the kettle a bit fuller than she is used to, we are able to get around that problem.

Now that she's had two months of kettle ownership, she is much better at aiming water into the kettle, and doesn't have so many problems.  She has also noticed that with the flatter and wider bottom of the new kettle, it does heat faster, and it is easier to clean with the nice enameled finish.  However, I think next time that we need a new kettle, I'm just going to install a hot water dispenser at the sink.",319,17,0,8

Electronics_5,5.0,1,"Buyer beware when use with some USB-C to USB-C cable, you might get speed capped 40MB/s:

----------------Apr 26 2016 Update----------------
I changed my review score to 5 to reflect the additional tests I've done to clarify the speed cap myth with Macbook.

After I consult with Apple forum, I get a answer that I might need a USB 3.0 USB-C to USB-c cable. So I did a search, and the ONLY cable mentioned USB 3.1 10Gb/s support is from Belkin:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Belkin-3-Foot-3-1-USB-Type-C-USB-C-to-USB-Type-C-Cable-USB-C-Certified/dp/B00WJSPCSG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Belkin 3-Foot 3.1 USB Type C (USB-C) to USB Type C Cable, USB-C Certified</a>&nbsp;And I tested with Macbook, it correctly recognized with USB 3.0 speed and pushed speed to it's limit. photo 7-8

So, in conclusion, If you want to achieve best performance with USB-C cable, make sure you have a USB-C cable support at least 5Gb/s transfer speed. And some cable like Apple's USB-C, Google's USB-C, Anker USB-C they only support 480Mb/s which is USB 2.0 standard for data transfer.

----------------Old Review----------------

I purchased it to used with my MacBook Retina 12' because of the USB-C support
But there is a real problem for this drive to use with USB-C to USB-C cable:

If you use it with Apple USB-C to USB-C cable, you only get USB 2.0 speed which is capped at 40MB/s in and out. Like the photo 1-3 show below.

If you use it with the accompany USB-A to USB-C cable you will have USB 3.0 speed which is 400MB/s in 425MB/s out. But the inconvenience part is for MacBook you have to use a USB-C to USB-A adapter like the photo 4-6 shows.

So in conclusion: if you purchased it for the USB-C convenience and universal support, you will disappointed with the speed seriously capped into USB 2.0 standard. For the best performance, you have to use the USB-A to USB-C cable, which will put it back to the same category of using a microUSB cable: you'll need adapter to make it work in full speed.",333,26,0,10
Electronics_5,3.0,1,"seSo I've owned this about a month. I was so impressed by the specs when placed next to the cost it was an easy win. I was concerned ONLY about the issue regarding the hinge but as just about every laptop has a downside I thought I'd risk it. Well I'm feeling pretty bad about this because though the price seems good for the specs a $1200 laptop is not budget and the three things I depend on every time I turn on the unit is DISPLAY, TRACKPAD AND KEYBOARD. Keyboard is a biggie for me and I give it a favourable rating. Trackpad is giving me hell. I had a great time with the synaptics software on my the lenovo I traded this in for. But the software that supports this trackpad is oversenstive. Cursor flies all over the place doing all kinds of madness while I'm typing. Constantly stopping to undo what it has done. Not a soul at ASus has replied to that query. Display was NEVER  a feature I spend alot of time on before because displays just did what displays should do but this yellow tint on the unit that so many other complain of that I didn't realise before makes my eyes hurt. I have done all I can do to calibrate but nothing really helps.

He has a time trying to pick it up with toilet paper without getting it on him or something else.....these are a MUST HAVE item in my house since he's living with me. This will also save money on toilet paper.  My pup is trained to use the potty pad inside, and also to go outside. He's a pomeranian, and I trained him this way so that when it rains or snows, he will be able to go indoors. It's been so nice to not have to get all bundled up in the winter and brave the cold, snow and ice. They've already come in handy, and will last a long time. I know who to get them from now when we run out. The container to keep them in is small, and easy to clip to a belt loop or leash, and am able to grab one easily. The bags are also a good thickness.

The problem: There is far too much hand wringing over ""torture"" and and other liberal causes (saving africans from genocide, profiling of muslims, Gitmo, evil right wing terrorists) it is difficult to watch. It is such an odd take on 24, which has always been about doing what it takes to beat the bad guys and preserving freedom and the American way. You wonder what the writers were thinking (Presumably, we really hate George Bush). There is also an amazing (and not very beleivable) resurrection of a previously dead 24 character, a feat only Jack Bauer could accomplish up until this season. Lots of eye rolling ensues.  24 has always had liberal elements. (All good presidents are black and/or women, all bad corrupt presidents are white men.) But this season really takes it over top. The last straw was near the end of the season ultra left winger Janeane Garafolo, playing an FBI analysts (the evil CTU has been disbanded, presumably for torturing too many people), whines incesantly about how the FBI was ""trampling the constitution""  by ""profiling"" and jack apologizes to her! I nearly barfed. Add then the peaceful innocent muslims who are framed as terrorists by the evil right wingers and well, you get the picture.  They just beat you over the head week after week with every liberal cause you can imagine. And let's not forget the  slow weepy finale that fades to black before resolving many key plot elements. Does Jack die from being exposed to a fatal biological weapon?, Who knows? Does Renee turn into Jack Bauer and kill the villain? Your guess is as good as mine. Ugh. The worst all the 24 seasons.

 It seems more work but worth it. Just washing with water took out some of the dirt already. Then with detergent, the dirt were basically ready to come out. I rinse the carpet twice just to be sure it is soap free.

There are hundreds of reviewers here that have been happy with this setup on an AR, but it just didn't work for my use (150 yards or less, mostly 100). When it was on, it was on. It just never stayed. You really need to have a strong understanding of MOA, scope centering and sighting, field of view, point of impact, etc, but especially with the cheaper scopes, as the adjustments will be crude and course. With higher end optics, the settings and adjustments are smooth and precise. I was able to mount this to my son's 10/22, and hopefully that will be an appropriate application.

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,4.0,1,"Great kit for the money - similar priced items on Amazon and in stores are junk and prone to stripped threads and broken plastic. This is a solidly crafted set of pistol cleaning tools, with all-metal rod and slotted tips, and an actual metal bushing in the plastic handle. Avoid the others in this price range (including the Hoppes branded ones); the all-plastic handles will crack and the plastic slotted tips will break.

THIS KIT DOES INCLUDE 22, 32, AND 44 CALIBER.

For some reason, the item description on Amazon and the packaging of the item don't mention this, but instead states ""5 calibers"" lists 38, 357, and 9mm as separate calibers... it has two bronze brushes, a cotton swab, and a slotted tip for 22cal. It does NOT have a bronze brush for a 32, but does have a designated cotton swab and slotted tip. It has a dual-purpose 44/45 bronze brush, 44/45 cotton swab, and slotted tip.

CALIBERS:
-22 family (223/5.56, 22 Short, 22lr, 22 Jet, 22wmr, etc)
-32 family (32acp, 32sw short/long, .327mag, etc)
-9mm family (38spl, 357mag, .380acp, 38 super, 9mm para/luger, 357sig, etc)
-40 family (40sw, 10mm Auto, etc)
-44/45 families (44spl, 44mag, 45acp, 45lc, 45-70, 45gap, etc)

PROS:
- Almost all metal parts (rod, brushes, tips)
- Plastic handle is made to last, has metal bushing (these typically break first)
- Small durable case, easy to stow in range bag, sturdy clasps

CONS:
- Lacks 32cal bronze brush, but has two 22cal bronze brushes?
- Rod is short, and may not be suitable for 8""+ barrels
- Difficult to remove some parts from case (handle)

4/5 stars because it really ought to have a 22 and a 32 bronze brush, rather than two 22 bronze brushes.

First timers, remember to buy lubricant and a barrel solvent/cleaner, and be sure it won't harm your polymer framed handgun! Hoppes is good but there are many other brands that work well.

I did have to unscrew it when I first got it because the battery had come loose and was rolling around in the lamp, but I simply stuck it back into place and the lamp works fine. The colors are vibrant and really pop both during the day and when it's lit up at night. And the light is actually a rather bright white, which is emitted from a small stalk of three tiny LED lights gathered into a bunch at the bottom, like grapes. The stake leaves a little something to be desired, though, since it was a little difficult to put together (I had to take the screw out of the pole and then re-insert it, since it was in crooked) and it's not the sturdiest while in the ground. The stake itself is fine enough, but the pole is so narrow that it can't really support the weight of the lantern, which causes the lamp to easily swivel around. But once it's in place, it's fine. I have it next to my walkway to add curb appeal to the front yard, and it looks really pretty both during the day and at night.

Movies_and_TV_5,1.0,1,"If Jean-Luc Godard hated commercial film producers, why did he make a movie for them?  To make some adolescent point about how he, The Brave Artist, would never be cowed by the vulgar likes of Carlo Ponti or Joseph Levine, I suppose.  And to prove that he could get  Brigitte Bardot as naked, or naked-er, than her ex-husband Roger Vadim.
Somehow, though, I suspect that even Vadim would have done better by this material than Godard.  After all, he has a good cast (Bardot included), good source material (a novel by Albert Moravia), and the services of Raoul Coutard, one of the best cinematographers in the history of film.  And what to we get?  About 90 minutes of mind-numbing agony as Godard plays film-school in-jokes and stretches scenes out to tedium mostly to prove that he won't truckle to commerical interests.  But none of this adds up to real drama, either.  As a result, any honest audience will have to admit that they've been cheated, too.

Electronics_5,4.0,1,"I'm really enjoying this lens. It's been an excellent choice, and has given me a lot more options than just my Nikon 50mm 1.4 D prime. I use it as my all-time walk around lens now.

Pros:

Construction quality is great. No dust in the lens, built big and tough. I took it camping with me and it held up great.
VC is fantastic. Not too loud for me. I like that I can hear it put itself into action.
Photos are sharp and clean.
Low light photos are no problem.
The lens lock button works well so the lens doesn't creep, but don't really need it. The zoom ring is tight enough to hold it.
Lens is easy to operate in manual focus mode too.
Price price price! Much less expensive when compared to the Nikon counterpart that doesn't have VC.

Cons:

Focus is not prime-lens-fast, but definitely quick enough to get the fast shot off  (just comparing to my prime 50mm 1.4).
Doesn't focus well on far away mountains / clouds. Sometimes the focus has a hard time locking on to things my prime has no problems with.
The lens is big, does add size and weight to my Nikon D300, but it balances well on the body.

My photos with the lens are here: [...]. I label the photos with tags on the right, so you know which lens was used.

I highly recommend this lens.",239,28,1,16

Movies_and_TV_5,4.0,1,"Highlights: Terrifying scenes of suspense and building of tension; immaculate cinematography depicting lifeless England; most of the performances, principally lead Cillian Murphy's and the reliable Brendan Gleeson's; alternative ending is KILLER.
Lowpoints: Too much zombies, too little subliminal terror at times; Megan Burns as the little girl is a truly terrible performance that fortuitously doesn't bring the film down.
Conclusion: An unflinching, metaphorical look at the possible loss of control over rage amongst humans, 28 Days Later marks Danny Boyle's comeback from his flop The Beach. Petrifying with its realism and astounding in its contrastive moods, 28 Days Later definitely has more in common with the director's dark masterpiece Trainspotting - it is scary, droll and compelling, and will linger with its audience, despite its flaws, long after the ending.

Books_5,5.0,1,"I've had the chance to read quite a few books that provide guidance and examples of how to become a better professional designer. After reading David Berman's most book Do Good Design, I find myself to be enlightened and newly aware of the social influence and ethical accountability of visual design.

David states that technology has turned the world into designers via personalized interfaces, computers, and cell phones which segues into the his core thoughts:

- Designers have more power than they realize
- The largest threat to humanity's future just may be the consumption of more than necessary
- Human civilization...can not afford one more major global goof
- The same design that fuels mass overconsumption also holds the power to repair the world
- We live in an unprecedented technological age where we can each reach a larger legacy by propagating our best ideas than by propagating our chromosomes
- Designers can be a model for other professions for identifying ones' sphere of influence, and then embrace the responsibility that accompanies the power to help repair the world
- Don't just do good design, do good

While I won't list all of the book's chapters (Amazon already has a TOC link), I'll highlight a memorable quote from each major section:

- The Creative Brief: Disarming Weapons of Mass Deception
""Designers can use their professional power, persuasive skills, and wisdom to help distribute ideas the world really needs""

- The Design Solution: Convenient Truths
""Imagine again a society's potential where the largest signs, the cleverest ads, the most prominent messages promote healthy behaviors....We can choose it now.""

- The Do Good Pledge
Immediacy - The time to commit is now
Ethics - I will be true to my profession
Principles - I will be true to myself
Effort - I will spend at least 10 percent of my professional time helping repair the world

I don't think I ever took notice of the magnitude of ads / visual lies that were around me before I read David's book. I HIGHLY recommend this book and I hope that once people read it, we can start showing the truth altogether.",359,25,0,21

These little big salt and pepper shakers are really cute, and well made. They easily stand on their own and make such a cute little set!
The noses come off to allow the inside to be filled, and the opening was large enough that filling them was very easy.
The silicone noses are brightly colored and although they are easy to remove when you want to, they DONT slide off any other time. To remove, you simply slide a fingernail under the side and peel it up.
I was a little hesitant about the size of the holes. I feel like they could be made just a tiny bit bigger, BUT I personally have 2 kids and DO appreciate that they can use these without worrying about them dumping too much seasoning on their food. If I decide to widen the holes then I know it will be easy because of the silicone.
I have put these through the dishwasher with no issue, although I do not plan (or really foresee a need) to do it again.

All in all, these little piggy shakers are a really adorable little set, and very well made. They made a great addition to my kitchen and I would recommend them to anyone who is looking to replace any other boring salt and pepper shakers!

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,4.0,1,"I wanted a compact rain shell for traveling; it is better to pack layers instead of carrying a big coat. This rain jacket is impenetrable to water when I run a sleeve under water, and it is completely dry afterwards. I have not used it in the rain yet.

I bought the jacket ""big"" so it could be a shell and I could layer underneath it (with a packable down coat, fleece, and/or hoodie). On its own, the jacket looks comfortable and cut nicely, but not big. I am 5'6"" 105 lbs and bought size medium for growing room (I like jackets loose anyway), but it already looks great as it is.

This jacket has features I did not expect, including elastic around the bottom hem (length comes to mid pelvis) and the around the hood for cinching. There is a mesh flap in the back for breathability. These are great features. I noticed the hood is not oversized at all. Cinched up, I think I could probably keep my face dry.

The tag on my jacket said it was $60, but I got it for less than $28; love the Amazon price! It also says it packs into itself, but I cannot figure out how to do this. I rolled it up and am using hair bands.

I dropped the rating because the color represented is not the color I received, even though I like it. ""Bright rose,"" instead of being a dark magenta as is shown, is just darker than hot pink.

Apocalypse Evolution was a good story.  Its definitely science fiction with a nice apocalyptic touch.  There were a few unbelievable parts, but in science fiction, you can have totally out there things that could/would happen in certain circumstances.

Bryces writing was tight and to the point.  There wasn't too much wasted time in this short story.  The comes at a slight fault, though, we really don't know much about Eve and her backstory other than that she is basically on borrowed time and being hunted.

We were both very excited to see the movie based on the previews we had seen & our love for animated movies...

This movie will NOT disappoint you! It was an absolute GEM of a movie!!!
Although we saw it in 2d, it was visually STIMULATING, with STUNNING effects, action sequences & characters!!!
All the characters, scenery, and animation were Simply AMAZING!!!
Not too mention the voices of all the characters were a perfect fit & each voice over was clear and accurately defined!

Now for the story...
It was a well written story with built in Humor, loyalty, friendship and love!
A story that kids of all ages & adults could follow & believe in!

There is something in this movie for Everyone that watches it:)

If you have children, take them to see this movie ASAP... it is the perfect time of year, and will add to the Holiday Spirit...
If your child, ask your Parent or Parents to take you to this movie...
If your an adult, go see this movie... it will most likely bring back fond memories and you will leave the theater fulfilled!!!

Books_5,3.0,1,"For the untrained Clive Barker reader, Abarat will seem like a vivid dream, an elaborate creation, a thing of wonder and beauty to be praised and revered. To the serious Clive Barker reader, it amounts to the PG-13 version of Weaveworld and imajica combined. Clive has taken to the all-ages genre and created a series that is sure to make him richer than he already is, but he's not doing anything new and that is very frustrating for the Constant Reader. Abarat is a story about Candy Quackenbush who lives in the dullsville town of Chickentown, Minnesota. She is an outcast, an exile, and she can't wait to get away. Well. as you guessed, adventure finds her and she winds up in The Abarat, a series of islands in the nether world each dedicated to a certain our of the day or night. Yawn. Very formulaic for Barker. This is Clive on cruise control. This is Clive on auto-pilot. This is Clive writing for the sake of writing, being weird for the sake of nothing better to do. Clive Barker is good at being outlandish and strange and thinking up attorcities and oddities is his modus operendi. Get a clue. This is nothing new.",204,15,0,1

Patty Jansen has done a remarkable world building job, building a complex interplanetary society structured around 'gamra,' with earth and humanity as we mostly know it, sitting on the periphery. Cory Wilson is earth's second ambassador to 'gamra' - but the first ambassador who actually understands the society he's about to be thrust into.

The politics, cultural differences and language differences are complex, but well developed and understandable, and I was easily drawn into the world that she created. At times I felt as hot and bothered and exhausted as Cory, struggling to adapt to the heat of a world far from earth, or as frozen as Thayen, drenched and shivering from experiencing temperatures well below her norm.

The story moved rapidly, and I was drawn in very quickly, and kept tapping the pages of my kindle much longer than I should really have been awake.

I've been reading Science Fiction for a long time. This story is good. It's not simplistic, but neither is it so far out of left field that it has more culture than character. It's a really good tale with enough twists and turns to keep you flicking the pages, and the characters are real and develop from moment to moment. I'm now looking forward to reading the next one.

The motor is so loud you can't hear the music over it, and it just doesn't keep her attention for long at all.

Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,1,"My in laws got this for our son who is one this Christmas. He absolutely loves it! I put together a pros and construction based on my opinion:

Pros:
- it has three different paths it'll take depending on which position the rail switches are. This keeps it entertaining.
- very easy to put together. The instructions are very simple to follow. It is a little time consuming because you have to screw in nails about 15 times or more throughout. It probably took me about 30 minutes.
- it is well structured. I'm not too worried about it falling apart anytime soon. My one year old is pretty rough with it and it doesn't even flinch.
- comes with two cars (one boy and one girl). You can also use different cars to that you may already have like hot wheels and the smart wheels cars. Our kids have all kinds that they use.
- Even my 5 year old enjoys it. Sometimes I have to remind her that she needs to let her little brother play with it.
- No batteries needed! We all know that's always a plus.
- let's kids use their imagination! Any toy that allows kids to do this is a plus for me.

Cons:
- It is a bit large. We live in a apartment and this takes up a lot of space. It's about 37 inches tall and 18 inches in width. If you have the space, won't be an issue.
- It doesn't have two entrance paths so the cars can't race. This didn't seem like a big deal but my 5 year old has been taking about this, so I thought I would add that in here.
- There's a lot of pieces when building so for some it may be overwhelming. Don't worry the pieces all are numbered and colored so very easy to identify when building.

Overall, I would highly recommend this toy for little children. Even adults can have fun with it.",335,33,3,17

Movies_and_TV_5,4.0,1,"I simply can't understand the vitriol that has been heaped on this movie.  I didn't see Alexander in the theatre, so my only experience with it is the director's cut DVD, which I thoroughly enjoyed.  Oliver Stone brought Alexander and his times to life for me, and Colin Farrell did an excellent job putting a human face on a man who thought he was a god.  Don't be put off by the jabs of spoiled movie critics - watch this lavish and engrossing film, and enjoy!

The only flaw I saw with the film - and it may be an insurmountable one - is that so much went on in Alexander's life, that it is probably impossible to present it all in a single movie.  Stone gives us a glimpse into the political, military, and personal aspects of Alexander's story, and these really can't be fully appreciated unless one has first familiarized oneself by reading the various accounts of Alexander, especially those written by his ancient biographers.  I may be reading too much into it, but I think the central theme of the Stone film is given us when, on Alexander's wedding night, he responds to his new bride""s question about whether he loves Hephaestion by saying, ""There are many kinds of love, Roxane.""  Oliver Stone's Alexander has many loves - his father, his mother, Hephaestion, Bagoas, the army, glory, war, his vision of a united world empire - and his attempts to give full devotion to each one drive his extraordinary career and, it would seem, eventually lead to his own self-destruction.",263,8,1,10

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,1,"Beautiful well-fitting faucet with well constructed hardware that operates smoothly.

First of all, you'll need a baseplate for most installations as the faucet does not come with one. This one:
Hansgrohe 14019001 Baseplate Kitchen Fits All, 10 Inch, Chrome
fits perfectly and the chrome matches the faucet. It costs around $40.

Next, the instructions are not particularly helpful for the non-plumbers among us. We hired a plumber for the installation. He was able to complete the task in about 80 minutes and charged $85. Note that if you have a separate spray attachment on your sink, you'll need to remove that and cap the hole.

The faucet has a switch on the top to go from smooth flow to spray, and the end of the faucet can be pulled out so that you can fill pots that are beside the sink using full flow. This is a significant feature.

This is not a small faucet, and it's just a little too tall for a small kitchen with a standard sized double sink. However, while it might look a little disproportionate, this improves the convenience factor since there will never be the possibility of something not fitting under the faucet and into the sink. It's a great faucet for larger sized sinks.

The handle works well to adjust both flow rate and temperature. Note that the faucet favors the right-handed person due to the position of the handle. No leaks, drips, or other annoyances. In use, the faucet is quiet. I'm very happy with the end result.",256,20,0,3

I have taken some pictures of the light. One in a pitch black bathroom and the other on our bar with a watch for size comparison. The light has two brackets on the back for hanging it. Screws are included with the light. One thing I really liked about the light is that the lens is frosted. That way, I don't get blinded by the super bright LED's. It puts off tons of light. I was really surprised. There is a three position switch on the side. Off, On, and Auto. When switched in the auto position, it is motion sensitive. I tested this in both low light and no light situations. The light will come on when it detects any motion. I walked in front of the light, then out of it's field of view. The light went off in about 5 seconds. As soon as I walked back to the light, it came on again. It will stay on as long as there is motion in front of it. This will work great in our pantry or under the sink, where there is no lights.  This is a really nice light and is going to make finding that lost can of furniture polish  a lot easier.

Movies_and_TV_5,4.0,1,"The two Michael Powell directed pictures in CLASSIC BRITISH THRILLERS give good indication of the great work he'd produce later, although they are somewhat hampered by small budgets. The James and Pamela Mason murder mystery is quite engaging.

SYNOPSES--

THE PHANTOM LIGHT--  The lighthouse keeper at a quaint Welsh coast village dies mysteriously, and his lighthouse is now supposedly haunted-- an unexplained light keeps shining on the scene of his death. The story's atmosphere is literal, with lots of blanketing fog, plus a murder mystery that's equally shrouded and obscured. Primarily filmed within a lighthouse, this whodunit has more than its share of ethnic humor.

RED ENSIGN--  Leslie Banks plays a somewhat pushy manager of a shipyard whose revolutionary boat design encounters much opposition and skullduggery from the competition and his own financers.

THE UPTURNED GLASS--  A story told in flashback. Neurosurgeon's affair with a married woman ends with her defenestrated death. Suspecting the woman's sister is involved, the surgeon plots revenge on her. Easily the best of this small collection. Co-written by Pamela Mason.

If I should have to use it in a emergency situation and filter outside waters in it, Ill update.

The instructions say to flush the system out twice before using, in which I did. It takes awhile for the water to pass through the filter.

The water is silky almost like drinking distilled water.  There no smells or odd tastes. I drink a lot of water & its nice to drink from a stainless steel tank rather than a plastic Brita or plastic jug, even if it claims to be BPH free.

Instead of using my refrigerators ice cubes, I make my own from the AlexaPure Pro. The ice cubes are clearer and theres no more particles floating in my drinks after the ice melts.

Books_5,2.0,1,"I think like many book series, you can't start mid-series. I read many glowing reviews of this book and most of them mention the previous books. Coming into this fresh (I'd not heard of Joe R. Lansdale), the characters and the plot seemed very thin, although the earlier books probably established these elements. When I first started the book, it seemed like a strange amalgam of political correctness, graphic violence, and Fletch-like irreverence. As the story progresses, however, dreadful scene piles on dreadful scene until the book comes across as truly sadistic.

There is an ugly American (Billy) who seeks to humiliate a Mexican girl in the most unpleasant and crude matter. The reader endures many pages of this behavior. I suppose these scenes are intended to justify Hap and Leonard brutally assaulting this guy again and again and again. Finally, Hap literally spreads his own feces on Billy's face, beats him, and makes him stand in the corner. And then does it again. This comes in a scene right after our ""heroes"" discover a girl that's been dismembered with a machete. The reader is treated to an explanation of where the individual pieces of the girl are located about the hotel room. The graphic violence continues up until the final chapter of the novel.

Oh, did I mention that the book opens with a brutal beating of another girl whom Hap saves?  Unfortunately for the girl, Hap doesn't save her until after she's been repeatedly raped, had her face ""stomped in,"" her nipple bitten off, jaw crushed, teeth knocked out, and lost an eye.

Books_5,2.0,1,"Koontz in ""The Husband"" reinvented the definition of a quick read. Read first 20 pages and then the last 20 pages and that's pretty much all you'll need to get the most out of this chicanery.

The book's cover describes an ""earth-shattering"" climax. Reviewers talk about a ""hair-raising"" thriller. Did the standards of the book publishing sink so low that anybody who may have previously published something worthy can now pretty much sell mule's crap to the public by slapping a colorful bow on it and labeling it an ""earth-shattering"" droppings?

Yes, the book starts out just as advertised. But then quickly goes down-hill from there. Koontz did not spend enough time on the characteristics of his protagonist Mitch Rafferty and his wife Holly so that readers connect with them and sustain the nerve-racking feeling from beginning to the end.

Movies_and_TV_5,4.0,1,"I've loved this movie since the first time I saw it in theater.  Its Andrew Dice Clay's first feature film and it delivers the typical Dice-persona antics.  Yes he had many misogynistic jokes at the time, but I separate this movie from his comedy; I mean, he takes care of a koala bear in the movie, how mean could he be?

The movie is about his character Ford Fairlane, a rockabilly style detective who works on cases for rock stars.  The only problem is most of his clients pay him in things other than money, such as guitars, sex, etc...

He comes across a case that involves finding 3 different cds or something like that.  I mean, they actually tried to put a plot in this movie, but you could have had a movie alone with just the main characters antics.  In a classic scene, Ford wakes up with two women in his bed and as the women start to leave he pleasingly begs them, ""hey girls, make breakfast, do my laundry""; classic stuff.

Eventually, Wayne Newton shows up as the bad guy and we are treated to scenes of Ford Fairlane making witty remarks towards Wayne Newton's character(Julien Grendel).

If you want to brush up on classic 90s films or just a decent comedy in general, check this one out.  His comedic style may or may not work for you, but I think if you start watching it and your entertained you'll be pleased with this one.",248,11,0,8

I'm trying to figure out if the other reviews and I read the same book.  The story was kinda disjointed.

But I have to say I really felt a strong connection to the hero, Luke. I've read several of these types of stories before and liked the main characters but Luke has to be among my all-time favorites! He just seemed real and fallible and I loved how the author didn't make him too macho in the beginning or too sappy at the end! I loved his humility and his desire to ""do the right thing"" as situations arose even when other people in the community questioned his decisions. Luke comes back to town to be the interim sheriff and Holly cannot believe it! Luke almost destroyed her family, mostly her father, who is the current sheriff, when they were teenagers and she can't forgive Luke for that. Why is her father giving his job to Luke? Holly has so much on her plate, namely a young son who is getting in so much trouble, a father who she doesn't understand, a business that is stressing her out and she's a widow! Her town is falling apart and now Luke is back in town after a decade away - WHY???? Luke, on the other hand, was the child of the town drunk, and he knows people are not going to accept him until he shows them he's not like his father. There's a lot to do in Butterfly Harbor and he's going to do his best to help the struggling town but he's going to need Holly's help...if she'll just forgive him.

Stars Christopher George as the park ranger , Richard Jaeckel as a naturalist and Andrew Prine as a vietnam vet running a helicopter service. A 18 foot two thousand pound grizzly goes on the rampage taking out campers , a couple of park rangers before coming to the final showdown with the George character who instead of a scuba tank uses a Lors rocket launcher to destroy the bear.

Books_5,5.0,1,"Desert Of Souls is the highly recommended first novel of an Arabian Nights-style series by the new author, Howard Andrew Jones.  As many other reviewers have already somewhat detailed the storyline, suffice it to say it relates the adventures of a scholar and the captain of the guard of a member in the government of Caliph Haroun al-Rashid as they go in search of a powerful magical tablet.  Being chased by an evil spy and a Magi, they encounter a lost city in the desert, a djinn, a desert of actual souls (hence, the title), and other beings and objects, natural and magical.

It's written in the style of the Arabian Nights but with an emphasis on the action-adventure of a sword-and-sorcery tale.  The author also conjures up new magical creations and beings not found in the typical Arabian Nights tale.

We follow Diana on her struggle to get past the fact that she was raped.  She always believed that if anything bad was about to happen that the hero would swoop in and save you.  She had a hero with her, Gideon, did what he could to save her but on that day it was not enough in the physical sense.

As Diana fights to become a person again, Gideon is there every step of the way.  Even though there are more steps back than forward it seems.

Although his words to her that day did save a small piece of herself, she just needs to find the rest of the pieces to be whole again.

This particular unit has a 7 gallon capacity, a glass-lined tank, and a recovery rate of almost 7 gallons per hour.

In my review video I cover the main features and issues with this water heater, but briefly:

This 7-gallon heater is large! The dimensions are 17.5 W x 17.5 H x 14.5 D. This was too large to install in our bathrooms or kitchen, so we had to install this in our basement crawlspace.

Also keep in mind that the unit itself weighs about 30 pounds, and with the extra weight of 7 gallons of water, the total weight of the heater will be almost 90 pounds. We set the heater on cement blocks to make a firm foundation.

Hooking up the plumbing to the unit is relatively straightforward, though in our case, because we installed the unit in our basement, we had to tap into the hot water run.  But this location would also not cause any house damage if the unit leaked.

Hooking up the electricity was more difficult, since we had to hire an electrician to make a hard-wired 12A and 120V connection the heater needs.

We are happy with this unit. The time it takes to get hot water is much shorter than it used to be, and seven gallons is enough of a reserve that we don't deplete it before our main hot water heater kicks in.

So all in all we have been very happy with this Bosch water heater, though again keep in mind the size and weight limitations of the 7-gallon unit.

I hope this review has been helpful!",297,24,2,18

**About the workout:

I've owned several workout DVDs with the name ballet in the title.  IMO Ballet Conditioning feels more like taking a ballet class than the others because it is pure ballet, not pilates and not yoga.  The other ballet workout DVDs all have pilates and yoga.

Also, the workout concentrates on core and lower body strength, both vital to ballet dancers.  If you want equal attention to upper body/arms/shoulders, you won't find here.

i mute the dvd and use the CD ""Adagio by Herbert Von Karajan"".

I am short- 5'2""- and (was) 40ish lbs overweight so I ordered the L.  It fit very well with no riding up or sliding down at all.  There are no lines visible on your clothes to even hint that you're wearing something like this.  I ended up ordering another in the 2nd color & wear one or the other most days. It hasn't seemed to wear out in any way with numerous washings over the year.  In fact, drying them helps them regain snugness.  After a decent weight loss, it obviously doesn't work quite as well but I like the product enough to order both colors in a smaller size, perhaps even a couple of each.  They are comfortable and just help me feel sleeker, whether it's under a business suit, dress, or jeans!  Honestly, I feel wrong going without them now.  Compared to most effective shape wear, you simply cannot beat the price.  At my height, it does pull up to my bra line, which seems appropriate to me.

I marked it up for my youngest son, just starting out as an adult. Then I bought two more copies - one for oldest son, and another to replace mine. Adams' style is accessible and clear.

A few key takeaways:

- Use systems, not goals
- Try not to sell your time due to limited upside; your time is finite and limited
- Try to find a product that is infinitely scalable, that you can sell again and again (Intellectual Property might be one way)
- Piecing together complementary skills can make you _very_ much more effective
- Look to maximize your personal energy - the foundation of all else

Toys_and_Games_5,1.0,1,"The new board (the one with the round boulders for spaces, vs. old board with squarish spaces) makes it just about impossible to exit the ""endless loop."" They have changed the placement of the ""5"" and ""3"" spaces within the loop--previously, landing on one of these spaces would (unless you got a minus 3) guarantee your exit (in addition to landing exactly on the exit space), meaning you have a significant chance of being able to exit the loop on any given turn. Now, however, the ""5"" and ""3"" spaces will never land you on the exit--so they are pointless! There's almost no chance of landing exactly on the exit space on any given turn, which DRASTICALLY lengthens the game. The game has gone from fun to FRUSTRATING. And isn't the whole point of this to make math fun??

Our ""solution"" to this so far has been to just ignore the rule of landing exactly on the exit space, treating the exit space as any old space and ignoring the whole loop idea. This makes the game super short, but that's better for my 4 year old and she still gets addition/subtraction practice without the torture of drawing the game out for hours. I may end up taking a sharpie to the board and changing the placement of the 3 and 5 spaces to where they are SUPPOSED to be, to make it more playable.

When you push the center gear, all of the lights start flashing, music plays, and the gears (if they are still on the monkey) start spinning.  What I like about the toy is that the gear mechanism spin whether or not the gears are on or off and my grandson can put them on and pull them off without stopping the unit.  He loves monkeys, so this toy is perfect for him.

While I like learning toys, sometimes you just want a fun toy to play with.  This one accomplishes both - it is really fun and there is an opportunity to learn colors and improve fine motor control.  The inside gears are in the same colors as the flashing lights.  The outside gears are in similar colors.  You can play match the colors or you can mix them up on purpose.  I also noticed that the little balls that come with his other toys can sit atop the spinning gears and the balls spin, too!  Add to that the gears and knobs are just the right size for his one year old hands and he likes to chew them as he is now teething his last two canine teeth (he's already got 14 of his teeth) and the gears seem to hit just the right spot for those last two.

Movies_and_TV_5,5.0,1,"There are movies for all moods, for all tastes, for all
occasions. Some emphasize the dialogue, some the special
effects, others the story.

In this movie, there's a wide range or aspects that are
keep the viewers keenly watching the unrolling of the
movie, such that time passes quite quickly, and we get a
glimpse of a microcosm, surrounding the customers of a
small 7-11 style store in a major city.

William Hurt, plays a character that seems quite his own,
and natural, as does Harvey Keitel who reprises the
tough-guy with a big heart role.

The movie is not a chick-flick like many other movies,
such as Ashley Judd's SOMEONE LIKE YOU/ ANIMAL ATTRACTION
but it does have a very soft or human side to it, that
will appear perhaps to older audiences, meaning, those
over 23 ...since the emphasis is on the various tones of
human interaction, the small and introverted lifestyles
that sometimes people have in large city neighborhoods.
The key here, is showing people their human sides, and
willingness to grow, help their neighbors, and life in
peace with one another, responsibly.

Clearly, these types of movies, showing nostalgia, mixed
with urban living, realism, drama and responsibility in
each moment, are not the norm, considering the ""fantasy""
or ""unreal"" stories often chosen by Hollywood, that target
the below 17 age bracket.

Perhaps, at the end of the day, everyone will learn to
enjoy this small urban tale featuring OUTSTANDING acting
talent of William Hurt, and the legendary Harvey Keitel.

As for Ashley Judd, an extremely versatile and one of my
favorite actresses, she really does a shocking role in
this movie, playing a delinquent adolescent girl, not
unlike the other movie, NORMAL LIFE. This is the old Judd
that we used to see, in other movies of the same period,
such as Ruby in Paradise, or the Passion of Darkly Noon,
or a Time to Kill, or the Locusts, all great performances
with Judd. The later movies, seem to show a Judd in a
different phase of her life than before, but in
SMOKE, Judd's 5 minute performance will surely grab your
attention.

In terms of the DVD edition, the colors, sharpness of the
picture and audio, is top-notch.",373,46,0,3

Kindle_Store_5,4.0,1,"In this book, David Birkenhead is still technically a rabbit, but he's now a free rabbit, no longer considered a slave by law.  But as he recovers from his injuries and considers his future, it's clear that most people still consider him to be a slave in all but paper.

As much as the anthropomorphized animal aspects might be weird -- my wife, for example, was a little squicked by it -- it actually served as an interesting proxy for our own history of racial slavery in the U.S.  In many cases I could see people treating the rabbits in much the way old slaveholders of the U.S. south would have treated them, and I also see what that slavery has done to the rabbits psyche, in terms of their expectations, their choices, and their self-image.  More than any furry aspect, it was this comfortable view of slavery that got under my skin more than anything else.

So, this book takes David from his injuries through to his official decoration for his heroic actions in the first book, and then onto the navy's officer academy with the Kings full blessing.  Of course, not everyone wants to see David succeed as the first free rabbit to enter the academy, and there's quite a bit of good struggle over that.  Along the way, he befriends a few other students in the academy, and for the climax, they go to an interstellar wargames competition between two opposing academies.  He acquits himself fairly well in a move that would have made even Ender Wiggin proud.

So, I'm pretty jazzed about it, even with the bunny ears and slavery, and I'm looking forward to the rest of the series.",284,13,0,7

After one day, I got an abrasion to the top of my foot from the sandals.  I am not sure if it was because of the amount of walking I did, or were they shoes too closely fitted?  I have only worn them once, and I walked for quite a bit on the first day.  They were very comfortable and the nice lining helps your feet to not sweat.  So far so good, with exception of a small cut on top of each of my feet.  Hopefully it is just having to break the shoes in one day.

August 2014...Months later... these must be the worst Born sandals purchase ever.  Every pair I have purchased have been worn and worn.  However, the top strap of the shoe digs into the top of your foot.  I even had my daughter try them since she has smaller feet than me, and the top rubs slightly against the top of your feet when walking.

If you do not do a lot of walking, these shoes may be for you.  However, the top strap will rub gently, at first, into the top of your foot.  After a few hours, that gently part will start to form redness on your feet.  I never had Born shoes that did that to my feet before.  Maybe I just got a bad pair because it is mostly just the left shoe.",265,20,0,18

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,1,"I swim everyday as part of my exercise regime, and whenever I do not protect my eyes, they burn and become pink from the harsh chlorine in the water. I wanted a good quality pair of goggles to help me keep my eyes safe, and the Ipow Anti-fog Mirrored Silicone Swimming Goggles with UV Protection Plating Glasses + Premium Goggles Case seemed like an excellent option for me, so I decided to try it out.

These goggles seal watertight against my face, completely protecting me from water leaking through them and onto my eyes. They are cushioned, and their head strap is a comfortable silicone material. The lenses of the goggles are described by the manufacturer as anti-fogging, and so far I have not experienced any issues with fogging. They seem to live up to their claim. I feel comfortable wearing these goggles, and my eyes are wonderfully protected from burning and irritation caused by the chlorine water.

I truly do love these goggles. They are great for casual swimmers like myself, who just use them for exercise or for simple fun in the pool, but they would also be ideal for competitive swimmers. Their quality is very high, and they are so comfortable and effective. I am so happy that I ordered them. I intend to get a lot of use out of these goggles, and I believe that they will last me for a very long time.

He is on a job that requires him to be a good cop. He is on a job that requires him to be a good detective. He is on a job where he must solve a murder. He is on a job where he must solve a murder.

Toys_and_Games_5,4.0,1,"Issues and/or things to note:
1. Body proportions are all on point except for his head which is kinda small especially in comparison to Cap unless his helmet is supposed to be skin tight LOL
2. Diaphragm/ab and waist points of articulation are pretty loose.
3. More gaps than usual/before in the sculpt to where you can see through a lot of the figure at the points of articulation. (ex: upper and lower neck gaps, tailbone(?) area, and etc.)
4. Weird sculpt/design in some places. Giant, flat knee joints again and quite a few pieces that are sculpted outward on the figure that you should be wary of in case of breaking off like 2 little tabs on the back and the elbows which stick out a lot this time in a pretty ugly way.

Improvements from older Iron Man figures:
1. Body proportions are way better; bulkier as it should be to represent an actual man in a suit.
2. Repulsors on palms are painted this time unlike on the Mark 45.
3. I appreciate the little blue paint lines in each of the mini arc reactors all around the suit because I expected them to all just be plain silver.

Other than those, it's still an overall awesome figure. I suggest you watch AnthonysCustoms review of it on youtube if you want more details.
This Mark 46 is to the Mark 45 as the AOU Cap is to the CW Cap; Lots of similarities in pros And cons. But in the end, this is indeed my favorite Iron Man figure to date and in my opinion I think it's the best one that's been released so far.",279,24,0,6

I got it for evening walks with my dog and at first, I was really happy with it. It sheds a nice blue light and allows her to see where she's walking and, more importantly, allows passing cars to see both of us! It attached nicely to her collar.

Even before the clasp broke (in literally fewer than 10 uses), there were a couple issues--the light itself is very hard to turn on. I pressed both sides as hard as I could, and I ended up having to hit it against a wall to get the thing to turn on. Also, the clasp is difficult to get on a squirming dog. You'd think it would easily collapse so that you could slip it onto the collar...I don't want my dog wearing it all the time (just one more thing on her collar to jingle/get caught/etc.).

Movies_and_TV_5,4.0,1,"Inspired by the Allan Ginsberg poem of the same name, HOWL shows the eponymous hero (James Franco) reading the work out lout to a group of fellow-poets in San Francisco.  The work obviously inspired extreme passions: the audience listen in rapt attention to a work that depicts the poet's feelings through an earthy yet compelling idiom.  In an attempt to show how the poem might work, directors Rob Epstein and Jeffrey Friedman introduce a series of animated sequences; none of them try to 'explain' the work, but rather show how Ginsberg's language works associatively, inspiring moods rather than following any logical sequence.  When the work was first published in the mid-Fifities, it was the subject of a famous obscenity trial: Epstein and Friedman restage that trial, showing how the poem was criticized for its apparent earthiness of language, and then cleared on the grounds that Ginsberg was only following the principle of free speech.  HOWL is an enthralling piece, encouraging viewers not to 'understand' the significance of the poem in terms of meaning, but to see it as symptomatic of a particular moment in American history, when old taboos and/or standards of moral or civilized behavior were subject to intense scrutiny.  The conservatism of the early Fifties had been superseded by a new spirit of adventure, encapsulated in Ginsberg's work, that looked forward to the spirit of the Sixties.  James Franco offers a convincing characterization of Ginsberg, supported by memorable cameos from David Strathairn, Jon Hamm, and Bob Balaban as the main protagonists in the court case.",257,7,0,0
Books_5,5.0,1,"The Darling is a magnificent book, far ranging and very compelling. Russell Banks, like Wally Lamb, writes authentically in the voice of a woman, so much so that it is hard to believe this book was really written by a man.

The woman's voice is that of Hannah Musgrave Sundiata, a.k.a. Dawn Carrington, the darling of the title. What a misnomer! She is anything but darling. Selfish, self-absorbed and admittedly lacking any maternal instinct whatsoever, Hannah is not a sympathetic character, in spite of all she endures, nor even a very likeable one.

This is a story of a political radical's flight to W. Africa and her subsequent marriage to a black Liberian, which results in the births of three children. It is, of course, a tale of politics, race relations, and terrorism. But it is also a story of one woman's efforts to learn about herself and to make a life of value. Whether she ever succeeds at this goal is debatable.

They live in a small apartment on the edge of town, but all that changes when she finds out about his father's death. The story continues with Stephanie, Tori, Stephanie's best friend, and Stephanie's best friend. Stephanie is a recovering addict and is not sure if she will survive the ordeal of being in the hospital, or if she will be able to find a new life.

This is a good story with lots of information and with good characters. There are a few surprises along the way. I recommend this book to anyone who is looking for a good story that is not predictable. The characters are well developed, the story is well written and the plot is well written. The only thing I would change is that I will be reading more of these stories by this author.I have enjoyed all of the books in this series.  I have read all the books and will continue to do so",223,15,0,5

Movies_and_TV_5,5.0,1,"This is an excellent documentary about Allen's entire career.  There are many, many film clips and they are all choice highlights from his films.  Interspersed with these clips are interview segments with Allen present day and during earlier days.  There are also clips of mini interviews with the people with whom he has worked, including Tony Roberts, Diane Keaton, Scarlett Johannsen, John Cusack, Owen Wilson, Mariel Hemingway, Gordon Willis, Marshall Brickmann, Martin Scorsese, his sister Letty Aronson, now his producer, Dick Cavett and so forth.  Although Mia Farrow is covered, she does not participate in any way since they have never resumed contact in any way. She was, of course, Allen's other major leading lady but he ended up having an affair and marrying her adopted daughter years ago.

Even though I have seen every single one of his movies, I really liked the choice of film clips presented here.  It was very enjoyable to see them and to learn some of the tidbits about what else was going on while making them.  Everyone contributed some major insight about the film clip which was unknown to us before.

I also enjoyed the way he present day took us to his old school or walked down the street with his sister and they talked to present New Yorkers.  There was even old footage shown of his parents who finally died near the century mark.

Although the focus was on the work, there was enough of a human dimension presented here to make this a very important summing up of a creative life while the creator is still around to share it.  If you love his work, you need this film in your collection.

Books_5,3.0,1,"Adam Schonberg is in medical school and trying to make ends meet without the support of either his or his wife, Jennifer's, parents.  His family was not happy when he married outside the Jewish religion.  Now he finds that their already struggling family of two is about to be a family of three and he doesn't know how to cope or manage financially.  Jennifer will have to quit her job as a dancer and so Adam decides to take a leave of absence from medical school to go work for a drug company.  But all is not what it seems with their fancy corporate headquarters and high dollar paychecks.  Adam soon finds himself in the middle of a corporate plan to take over the field of medicine by drugging and mind controlling as many doctors as the company can get their hands on.  All the while, Adam must deal with the conflict developing between Jennifer and himself because of his suspicions that her OBGYN is drugged as well.

Cook weaves an extremely interesting conspiracy theory about how the business world is beginning to affect medicine and it's treatment, or lack thereof, of patients.  It confronts the  idea that for-profit companies will continue to have an influence on the field of medicine that is not always as positive as these companies would lead you to believe.  The unfortunate aspect of this book was that the story line jumped from idea to idea a bit and often portrays Jennifer in a overly simplistic and patronizing manner.  Just when the adventure really heats up, the story ends abruptly and rather predictably.  A story with a lot of potential ended flat and in disappointment.  Still, one still finishes with the contemplation that Cook intended.",290,13,0,0

Books_5,1.0,1,"The author, a secularist, does not bother to treat philosophical arguments for God's existence seriously. For example, he lauds Bertrand Russell's attack on the cosmological argument (p. 185) when, in fact, Russell created a straw man. In ""Why I am Not a Christian,"" Russell says that cosmological arguments all fail because they depend on this premise:

P1: Everything that exists has a cause

Or order to reach this conclusion along with one more premise:

P2: The universe exists.
-------------
C1: Therefore, the universe has a cause (God)

But Russell claims that C1 (God) would be subject to P1. God would require a cause for God's existence. If so, the argument fails.

This is absurd because I have never read a version of the cosmological argument (in 35 years of studying and teaching and writing about philosophy of religion) that used this argument premise. Of course, P1 will defeat a cosmological argument, but no one uses it!

For example, the kalam cosmological argument reasons this way:

P1: What every begins to exist, has a cause of its existence.
P2: The universe began to exist.
-----------
C1: Therefore, the universe has a cause (God).

Notice that the kalam's P1 differs radically from Russell's version: ""Everything that exists has a cause."" God, of course, did not (by definition) begin to exist, so is not subject requiring a beginning cause for God's existence. In order words, there is no reductio ad absurdum. Neither do the Thomistic or the Lebinizian cosmological arguments rely on Russell's manufactured premise.

One could go on about the cosmological argument (I devote 30 pages to it in my book, Christian Apologetics), but suffice to say that this book does not bother to critique the argument at its best, only at its worst.

That is a very bad sign indeed, but I find that many British secular philosophers are often dismissive of philosophical theism. Shame on them.",316,26,1,5

At times this book brought me to my knees because I could feel the pain of Liam and Quinn. These two have been dealt a s*** hand. The book does flip from past to present a little more than my liking but you do need the back history for their story to make sense.

Quinn is a kid that has a mother who doesn't want her, she throws her out at 15. She has to learn how to survive on the streets. Being a 15 year old young lady on the streets is dangerous. And living in the wrong part of town you only have a few options in survival, drugs to numb the pain or selling yourself to devil to have some money. She makes her choice and it is neither. She meets Liam and he is living the same life. No parents, the abuse can be to much when you go from foster home to foster home. Liam learns to fight to survive. And when he meets Quinn he fights enough for both of them. That is so much for anyone to handle but they both do they best they can with what they have. Now go forward 10 years, their demons are still with them. They carry them everyday but Quinn did what anyone at young age would do when her world crashes, she ran as far away as possible leaving Liam behind. Liam did what he did and does best he fights. MMA fighting. But what brings Quinn home brings them face to face again. The question is, is it to little to late or will they save each other once and for all?

The story itself is very well done, with the introduction of a lot of new characters. There is also a little bit of romance in this book, but it's not that bad. The main characters aren't that bad.

I was very disappointed with the way the book ended. I was hoping for a more more ""real"" ending, and that would have made the story more interesting.

I have to say that I'm not a big fan of the old relationship between the two main characters. I thought the relationship between them was well-developed and had some interesting twists. But, again, I don't think the author had a lot of fun in the way of the main characters.

Overall, I liked this book very much, and I'm not sure that I'll be reading any",262,16,0,21

Books_5,5.0,1,"Having lived in a cave for the last decade or so, I confess I had no knowledge of Jeremy Wade and his ""River Monsters"" television show. Glancing at the 'New Books' section of my local library, I spotted RIVER MONSTERS..and I was hooked. I'm glad I happened to spot Wade's book; it's a fascinating and informative guide to freshwater beasties few people even knew existed.

For the past 20-odd years, Wade, a Brit zoologist with a touch of Indiana Jones thrown in, has been traipsing the globe, searching for legendary freshwater fish. In RIVER MONSTERS, he shares the results of his quest and the results are eye-openers. Wade's descriptions of his efforts to find, fish for and land goliath tigerfish, arapaima, goonch, ripsaw catfish and longfin eels are wonderfully exciting, excitement only topped by the wonder of seeing actual photographs of those - often humungous - creatures. Along the way, Wade imparts valuable information on his finny friends and how they, in some cases, acquired fearsome if undeserved reputations as man-killers.

Yet, exciting as Wade's adventures are, there is a cautionary note running throughout the book. Overfishing is taking its toll of fishlife, large and small, worldwide and Wade points out the fact that many of the freshwater beasties he tangled with are threatened with extinction.

In short, RIVER MONSTERS is an appealing, exciting and insightful guide to aquatic wonders that - may still - lurk in freshwater rivers. Recommended.",240,12,0,7

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,2.0,1,"I really wanted to like these as I read so many good reviews, and they look great when worn. First off, I have deeper eye sockets and always have had challenges finding goggles that don't leak.

After seating the goggle and tightening down with a firm, yet comfortable tension, these goggles didn't leak for about 500 yards. Then a small leak started, which i think was from the outer edge. Fortunately, the water didn't funnel directly into my eye, however it was a distraction. After pausing my swim, drying my face and goggles, and tightening things down even more, the goggle didn't leak for another 100-200 yards then water came in again. I tried several other times to reposition and tighten things, but this model just wouldn't work for me. Side note, I ended up with large raccoon eyes and a major headache from tightening things down for at least 24hrs after my swim. I probably should have conceded sooner :(

The activity guide gives lots of great information about each of the animals in the set.  It gives information like why the animal is endangered, where they live, and special characteristics.  It also gives discussion starters and a couple of activities.

I opened it up and my son immediately asked questions.  He started to name the couple he knew.  I corrected or helped with the couple he didn't know.  We talked about the animals and a little about each.  I told him they are all endangered and of course he asked what that meant.  We talked a little about them, but mostly he just likes to pretend play with them.  He was pretending today that the manatee was swimming really fast and then he broke his tail so he was swimming slow and then it got better and he went fast.  Such a 4 year old play game.  There is so much play that can happen with these animals.  Pretend play is such a valuable skill to learn and why not add in some other learning.

But nonetheless, her description of people's personality and character is usually very spot on.

Movies_and_TV_5,5.0,1,"If you're a fan of the angelically irreverent Mark Twain, there's a *very* high probability you will enjoy this. It's a delightful interpretation of what Twain's lecture series performances would have been like. I particularly enjoy this performance because of the artistry of Mr. Holbrook's interpretation and delivery of Twain: Twain was supposedly the master of the comic pause for effect, and Holbrook seems a fine practitioner of that art.

Much of the material was familiar to me from reading Twain. Yet the performance certainly adds another dimension to one's enjoyment of Mark Twain's high art of civilized comedy and truthful commentary on the human condition. It is a comedy that is merciful to what is sincere and merciless to what is false - always seasoned with humility. It is a comedy, that with exceptions such as Garrison Keillor, modern America has forgotten. Twain's honesty, perspicacity, humility, and irreverence were what made him the luminary he was: The majority of modern comics only score one out of four on that list. If watching this performance motivates you to read one of Twain's books, I highly commend&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Roughing-It/dp/1626360634/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Roughing It</a>.

Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,1,"I purchased this toy for my daughters' birthdays (4 and 6), as a shared present, and they love building with it.  This is usually done as a ""group"" project, as some of the pieces are a little bit difficult to snap together for them (but honestly, I have trouble with a few of the pieces myself), but it's been great to see them working together and collaborating on a building project.

I was at first a little worried about whether or not all 400 pieces could be contained in the tote.  Opening the box for the first time dispelled that concern.  The box looked practically empty!  The pieces are very small, and barely cover the bottom of the storage box.  However, don't let that fool you, since you can build lots of things from this seemingly small sprinkle of parts.  The fact that they claim to be compatible with other snap-style building blocks is a bonus.  In any case, there is room for plenty more pieces, should you choose to buy more.

The downside of this toy is that the some of the pieces really are difficult to put together and take apart, and require a good deal of dexterity to do so.  However, given this fact, the finished products are pretty durable because of it.

The leg portion is very comfortable, but the top of the band leaves an indentation in my leg, and that's why I dropped one star from these excellent socks.  I'm folding the tops down to avoid that, but in my active outdoor life, I prefer higher socks for protection against insect bites.

For running around the house in socks, these are wonderfully comfy.  Where they really shine, though, is when you put on your shoes, and they never felt so good!

Construction:  You can see in the picture the open mesh knit on the top of the foot for coolness.  There's a ribbed band that goes completely around your instep to hug your foot. The bottom of the sock, including the top of the toes and up the back of the heel (except for the area of the instep ribbing) is all cushioned with terry loop knit on the inside.  So the sole is thicker than the top, and it's very comfortable.  You have cushioning where you need it most, without making the socks too hot or bulky.

Materials: With years of experience knitting socks myself, I can advise that for long-lasting socks, get at least 10% nylon in the fibers.  These socks exceed that, and should wear very well.

These are my favorite store-bought socks yet, but I'll keep looking for something that doesn't leave an indentation on my calf.  You can bet I'll be wearing these often in the meantime, though, and especially in hot weather.

UPDATE: After several trips through the washer and dryer, they've shrunk, and feel uncomfortably tight, especially around my ankle.  They're still comfortable in shoes, but I limit how long I have them on because of the restrictive feeling.",305,16,1,14

The plastic is not sturdy enough to stand up to a toddler.  The carpet is very messy.  This is a problem for most adults.  The bottom line is the wheels are not very durable and it is a little challenging to get them to move.  I highly recommend this toy.  I have a few other toys that have been very disappointing.

Wanted the antenna for local news/weather and sports.

With that said, I was very skeptical purchasing this contraption...so when it arrived, I was even more nervous as the antenna is literally paper thin with a black and white side!  Anyway, mounted it at the very top of my ceiling to give it every opportunity to succeed (they do give you a nice amount of cable so that you can mount fairly high up) attached end of cable to TV, set to Air, and had the tv do it's air scan and about 2 min later I have over 20+ free channels!  local news, sports, shopping channels, fox, and few others that I'm not really sure what they are...The picture and sound quality is amazing as well...almost as if I had HD cable!  I am very impressed with this and just purchased two more, one for the bedroom and the family room.

Toys_and_Games_5,3.0,1,"This little tea set just makes no sense to me.  The tea pot doesn't actually open, so you can't actually pour water into it.  Ok, fine.  It does make a cool pouring sound, but only randomly.  Most of the time it just bursts into song when tipped, and then makes the pouring sound when you bump it with your elbow or something.  It would have been awesome to have the option of turning the music off and just having the pouring sound to play ""tea"" with.  The songs are just strange and annoying anyways.  The cups too, while cute, have two holes drilled on one side.  So, heaven forbid your child actually pour liquid in, if they happen to try to drink from that side the liquid will just pour out of the side of the cup onto their lap before it even reaches their mouth.  The cake stacker thingy is actually pretty cute and fun.  And, my kids love this little set and mix it in with their other kitchen toys.  It was a gift, so we will keep it, but I would not have purchased this for them on my own.  I feel like the makers of this set assume that kids need constant electronic stimulation to keep them entertained, but I think the opposite is actually true.

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,1,"I did return mine - I have all tile floors with room rugs, and being semi-retired and self-employed from home I spend a lot of time in my slippers walking on the tile. The original cork built-up soles on the OG clogs are perfect for this whereas when I wear this Charisma with it's soft thinner sole in comparison it SEEMS I can almost feel the floor though the sole. That means not enough support for wearing them 10-12 hours a day every day. DANG it I love them and they were only $42 from Warehouse Deals....I do wish they had worked out! If you like the look I would encourage you to try them out and see for yourself how they feel. As a general house slipper, especially on wall to wall padded carpeting and just light use in morning, evening and weekends I bet they'd be GREAT.

DETAILS: Charisma is unmistakably a slipper (as opposed to a clog that could be worn as a shoe). Charisma has a snug fit - the size 42 for women's size 11 had my toe pushing right up at the top. Bear in mind one of my feet is 10.5 and the other 11 - the 10.5 foot thought the length was perfect. The fabric is very soft with some give and they actually felt OK even with my toes nicely wrapped up - for the 10 minutes I tried.  Like the OG clog style, these do have the molded foot bed with the slightly built up arch support. They are nowhere near as tough and stiff as the OG clog style; the sole is thinner and more flexible especially at the toes which are not bulbous and padded as are the OG clog style. The bottom of these soles are covered in thin ""grips"" that mildly keep them from slipping on tile so I would say these are not for use outdoors - much.",323,16,1,16
Books_5,5.0,0,"I've been reading Sir Terry Pratchett's books for a long time, and I'm pretty sure that I have had a similar experience.  The basic premise of the story is that a young man is kidnapped by a group of young women who are going to kill him.  The young woman is a fourteen-year-old girl, and the group of women is so obsessed with killing her that they have to take her away from her.  They all have plans to kill her, and they all get together.  The story starts out fairly straightforward, with a young woman in a wheelchair being abducted and killed.  She doesn't have a lot of tools, but she is a fairly skilled fighter and she does a good job of keeping herself safe.  She's also a very clever, intelligent woman, and the group of women are quite good at making sure that the children are safe, too.  I really liked that the group of women were mostly young people, but they also had a lot of good qualities, such as being very intelligent and strong, so they would be very able to handle situations, and they were a bit stubborn about it.

Toys_and_Games_5,1.0,1,"I ordered 4 boxes. Three basically had the same commons in all three boxes and there were easily 30-60 of any given card. The 4th box was mostly Blue (cards massively repeated, many over copies) and the rest of the commons were green. The commons were mostly junk commons (no lightning bolts/shocks/wild growth/counterspell type cards). One box came with 2-3 rares. The others had 4 or 5 but they were largely repeated across boxes. Some uncommon came in sets of four to fourteen. (4 of 11 or more copies) Nothing exceptional. I must have enough prodigal sorcerers by now to assure that they could go into every blue deck I will ever make again without ever reusing any of them. Condition was also an issue on more cards than I expected. The patterns of the commons almost made the repeats seem intentional, especially where five different cards would repeat 6-8 times in one section and then again later. All four boxes were underfilled. Don't waste your money or your time. These doesn't even make for a good beginner's collection because it lacks most of Magic's most important commons. No counterspell in four boxes???? Really? Oh and expect about 20 Circles of Protection. They've been printed in a lot of sets. At least there were 6-10 Healing Salves.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,4.0,1,"There are so many kitchen gadgets now that look cute, but really don't do what they promise.  You end up feeling cheated and tossing them out because they aren't worth the storage space they take up.  I'll admit that I figured this would be one of those gadgets.

I remember when the only time we had avocados is when relatives visited from Florida.  Now the stores here carry them, although they are unripe, so you can't eat them immediately.  I had to wait several days for my guinea pig avocado to ripen so that I could test the slicer.

You use the plastic ""knife"" part to cut the avocado length-wise and then you remove the part that isn't sticking to the pit.  This is the thing that surprised me, but the two halves came apart quite easily.  The instructions say to ""press the pitter into the pit.""  I couldn't get the metal parts to go INTO the pit, but they loosened it enough that it fell out when I turned the avocado over.  Job accomplished.

Then you position the slicer over the avocado half and pull it through.  Amazingly, it removes all the pulp in nice, neat little slices.  I've always peeled avocados and then cut the edible part off the pit in irregular slices.  It looks messy and there's a lot of waste. Using the slicer is a big improvement.

I'm leery of kitchen gadgets, but this one does exactly what it promises, is sturdy, doesn't take up much room in the drawer, and cleans up easily after you use it.  It's well worth the modest price.

Books_5,3.0,1,"I Heart Hollywood is the second book in the I Heart series by Lindsey Kelk. Angela Clark is back and she's still living in the United States, writing for a hip magazine, and debating whether to move in with her sexy new boyfriend. Her latest work assignment is interviewing fellow Brit and actor James Jacobs...in Hollywood. All is fun and glamorous until paparazzi snaps compromising photos of Angela and James Jacobs. The gossip spreads and threatens her job, reputation and relationship.

I really liked Angela's independent attitude and guts in the first book, I Heart New York. But she loses this burst of ""I Am Woman"" in this book. She seems helpless and clueless. I enjoyed reading more about her best friend Jenny, who is healing from heartbreak and discovering a potential new career. Hopefully Angela just had a temporary mental setback and will be back to normal. As Jenny says, ""You're my best friend. You do stupid stuff. I sort it out. This is our thing, it's the thing that we do.""

Lindsey Kelk's pop culture and smooth writing style make for easy, light reading. I love when a book takes me to different places in the world like New York, London, Hollywood, Vegas, and Paris. It's fun to read Angela's perception of the different cities. It's safe to say I am sticking with this series and can't wait to read the next two.

Ms. Reynolds has always been a go-to of mine when I'm in the mood for an alpha, but Nolan is by far the most possessive, protective, and yes, obsessed, alpha I've ever had the pleasure of meeting and Chloe is absolutely perfect for him.

Usually when I'm reading a novella I have a hard time feeling the connection between the hero and heroine but the connection between Nolan and Chloe was obvious from the first word. Yes, Nolan's an ass, and okay, maybe Chloe is a bit of a doormat, but who cares? It works for them, and it worked for me while I was reading it!

I love the whodunnit aspect of the story, but I love how that's not necessarily the main focus. The main focus totally being the smoking hot sexy times between Nolan and Chloe, of course! But I LOVE how they always end it with ""I Love You""... It adds the perfect amount of sweetness to counter balance the hotness.

My only complaint would be that I wish it were longer. And it would have been great to read from the beginning of their relationship, though even starting after they're already together I didn't really feel that we missed anything... That's just me being selfish and wanting more.

I cannot wait for the rest of this series and I'm really hoping we get to see more of Chloe and Nolan, too!

Electronics_5,5.0,1,"I bought this flashlight early december 2015. In recent months I've been using it at work and it has been dropped and tossed around in dusty crawl spaces. I wanted a flashlight that could use my old 18650 batteries that I won't use anymore for my e-cig.

Battery life seems alright. I pretty much always use the light on high and the 18650's i'm using are old and don't last nearly as long as it could with a fresh one. If you're battery is dying it will still allow you to use the low or medium brightness until it can't handle it anymore.

I've had this flashlight fall a few times with some falls taking little chunks of metal off it. I noticed other owners experiencing it not working after a drop. Luckily the one I have took the falls like a champ.

This flashlight is very bright. I'm not a flashlight enthusiast but when climbing into crawl spaces and peering through dark drop tile ceilings it really lights it up. I really like using the zoom feature when looking around. It will illuminate even the furthest darkest corner I would need it to.

Some cons for this light would be it can get hot quick depending on the temperature around you. The zoom markings are pretty silly and I don't think anyone uses it. The brightness and strobe settings are kind of annoying to deal with. If you skip the brightness you want you have to cycle it back again and if you turn the light off too quick it looses your setting.",264,17,0,15

We all would occasionally find ourselves with the need for a knife or wrench or screwdriver, but the campus where we work is a ""no weapons allowed"" kind of place, so even a Swiss Army type knife might ruffle some feathers.

Shipping took quite a long time - about a month - but considering that it's coming straight from China and you're only paying ONE DOLLAR apiece for these things, it's kinda hard to really gripe much.

Only complaint: The little page of instructions that tells what is what on this tool are entirely in Chinese. No English instructions whatsoever, so you've gotta guess what does what on this thing. I Googled it and there are some pics with numbers over each spot that list the function of each thing on this.

If you have a dog that's sensitive to eating something that is hard to digest, I'd suggest changing that up a bit.

The set includes all of Etaix's films, including his last, a documentary about the French during summer vacations.  It was this film that so outraged the French that Etaix was never able to make another film in France.  He meant it as a comedy, but the French thought he was making fun of them.  One of the long films, The Great Love (Le Grand Amour) starred his wife at the time as his wife.  The film Yoyo takes place over decades, with Etaix playing both father and son depending upon the decade.  In the years before 1928, the film is silent.

The Play-Doh that comes out of the tubes is not traditional Play-Doh. It's a softer compound making it easy enough for kids to squeeze. The Styler gun is simple to use; the kids didn't need any help changing it out. My 3 year old was able to do it a couple of times, but couldn't after his hands were reportedly ""wet"". I'm not sure if he had been putting his fingers in his or just clammy kid hands. I don't know why, sometimes kids just got clammy hands, they don't know either. Anyway aside from ""wet"" hands the kids were able to completely utilize the DohVinci Styler.

Another point about it not being traditional Play-Doh is that it's not reusable.

If you're a purist or die-hard fan, I understand why you wouldn't purchase this set though. For the casual fan, I think it's well worth the price. The transfer to DVD looks good. The set also comes with some nice extra features such as commentary from Gary Marshall, interviews, and more. The only other negative besides the edits is that the packaging is quite poor.

Where would  Europe and America be without the energy expended to resist the Turks,  Mongols, and Muscovites? Agincourt looks rather small beer when compared to  Zbaraz, Beresteczko and Vienna.

Books_5,4.0,1,"I'm very pleased with the 4th addition update of The C++ Programming Language.

Dr. Stroustrup takes the approach of presenting the current version of the language (C++ 11) as a whole, rather than attempting to show what's new in C++ 11 compared to C++ 03.  At approximately 1300 pages of text, it takes commitment to make it through the entirety of the content, but you'll most likely be a better programmer if you do.

If you've attempted to read previous versions and didn't like Stroustrup's approach, then you probably won't like the new edition either.  On the other hand, if you appreciated the 3rd edition, you will probably like the 4th edition as well.

He presents the language in a rather terse style of writing with very short and fairly contrived examples, so it's probably not the best book for beginners.  On the other hand, if you are already an intermediate to advanced C++ programmer, he explains a lot of the finer points very clearly.  Some of the topics he addresses are difficult to find documented elsewhere. For example the precise type of literals -- 3, ""foo"", 4.0, 5.1f;  internal vs external linkage; unnamed namespaces; etc. Since he invented the language and is a very active member of the standards committee, you can trust that the information is accurate.

One of the other things I like about this book is the fact that Stroustrup is wiling to editorialize just a bit and describe things that he considers to be ugly, embarrassing, or bad style.  He manages to do this without ranting, which is really nice.  He also gives advice about constructs to avoid and techniques to embrace.

Happy reading and good luck!",282,17,1,2

Movies_and_TV_5,5.0,1,"I always thought of Night Gallery as the second generation of Twilight Zone. This show is pretty similar to Twilight Zone in that it mixes the supernatural with Sci-Fi and suspense. Rod Serling had supposedly starting planning Night Gallery as early as 1964 when TZ was cancelled. Is Night Gallery as great as TZ? No, but it's a great ""second coming"" if you will. Night Gallery opens with Rod Serling describing each story with its own unique painting, which usually has to do with  something in the episode.

Season 1 is relatively short, containing only 6 50-minute episodes. The picture quality leaves a bit to be desired, as the picture is a bit scratched in some parts and colors seem a bit weak sometimes. The audio is relatively quiet so just turn your TV volume up nice and loud for this set. The Universal logo appears before each episode and it BLARES in comparison to the show's low volume.

The only sort of ""bonus features"" are some bonus stories. I'm not sure if these were unaired or just taken from other seasons, but they they're on disc 3 after the 6th and final episode of the season. Also included on Disc 1 is the original 1 and 1/2 hour Pilot film filmed in 1969.

Overall, the episodes appear complete though the quality isn't exactly as great as it could have been. Is the set worth 20-some dollars? I'd say not. I'd say its worth more along the lines of $10-15 as you don't get very many episodes. Nevertheless, I'd DEFINITELY add this to my collection for Night Gallery being the great show it is.",274,18,0,6

Now, the police are after the mysterious hero. Can THE SHADOW's alter-ego, Lamont Cranston (Kane Richmond) track down the real killer, before the police close in? BEHIND THE MASK is more comedic than I'd expected, as the original SHADOW was a dark, almost sinister persona, able to frighten the criminal element he was pursuing.

So, don't expect the more traditional, serious SHADOW...",129,10,2,2

Kindle_Store_5,5.0,1,"Party of Three: Sunday Night Dinner Club book 1 by Jess Dee is the beginning of a new series and what a terrific start. I loved the main characters of Spencer, Chelsea and Levi, but I actually found myself a bit torn at first on whether I wanted all three of them together. I adored Spencer right from the start, maybe it had something to do with him being an Accountant, lol :) Of course, that soon passed as I love when best friends share the same woman. The sex scenes were scorching hot and I enjoyed the fact that Spencer and Levi were able to discuss their feelings for Chelsea with each other. I also liked that this story introduced secondary characters who are long-time friends and I loved the close friendship that was portrayed and the fun bantering.

 Hume could go two ways: forgive or become a man of vengence.  Which way to go????
I will say that his ultra-impressive performances in  ""The Woodsman"" and ""Mystic River"" are nothing like he shows in this movie.  No depth of character for Bacon, which I believe is his bread and butter in the acting field.",104,7,0,4

Movies_and_TV_5,4.0,1,"I'm a Buffy novice. Watching only the movie last year, I had successfully avoided the Buffy phenom year after year. Perhaps it was the undue influence of a certain person that worshipped the shows as the best thing on. But it took my current boyfriend to turn me on to the Slayer and her gang of do-gooders that has made me a complete convert. I stand in the awe of Buffy.
Since I have no other seasons with which to compare this first season, I must say this is a delectable, funny group of episodes. Setting the course of the show, Sarah Michelle Gellar proves her talent early on, giving Buffy the appropriate menace and high school angst. She clearly carries the show on her shoulders, yet carries that mantle with utmost professionalism. Her cohorts are equally compelling. Alyson Hannigan plays Willow, a self-confessed computer geek, with a sense of wonderful innocence. Nicholas Brendon gives Xander, a loveable loser, dignity.  Anthony Head's Giles, know-it-all librarian, is stuffy and fun.
The twelve episodes stand up well, with only a couple of brain scratchers in the mix. The first two set up the series and its characters very well. Some of the favorites included the ""Angel"" episode, that finally helps solve the mystery of the character while seemingly adding more to it, and ""Nightmares"" where seemingly bad dreams enter reality. One particularly odd episode was ""The Pack"", where hyenas seem to enter a group of students as they proceed to reign havoc over Sunnydale, but I didn't buy it.
Overall, you can see the promise of this series in these early episodes. I was pleasantly surprised at the developing sense of humor that seemed to grow with each episode. I really enjoyed the comraderie between all the main characters, as they fight both those hideous Hellmouth demons and the trials and tribulations of puberty. Overall, it's been an enjoyable experience.
I'm eargerly awating to watch season two on DVD now, and find out what happens to Buffy and her gang!",338,21,1,12

This book starts off with Vaughn in the hospital, hell bent on finding Lark, who has stolen something that is very precious to him.  It is immediately apparant that these two have a history (which may have been revealed in the other books that I haven't read yet).  Once Vaughn is healed he sets out to find the elusive woman that stole not only property from him, but his heart as well.

Lark is on the run from her past.  No one knows who she truly is and she can't let anyone ever find out or else she is a dead woman.  Running has recently become harder after he last stop.  Not only did she make some really good friends but she went and fell in love as well.  That is how she knew it was time to move on, she promised never to let herself get too attached to anyone ever again.

With the help of his brother and a few close friends Vaughn is able to track lark down.  However, things aren't exactly as they appear and once he finds out who Lark really is there is nothing he won't do to protect the woman he loves and bring her back home where she belongs.

I'm concerned about other reviews that say the toggle for this setting will eventually blow out within 6-12 months.  I guess we'll see.  It won't be the end of the world as I'll then get to test some of the other shower heads I was looking at before deciding on this one :D.

I'm giving the product 4 stars instead of 5 just because as stated in another review, the design is a waste.  It's a wider spray, which I like, but the curved aspect of it is totally pointless.  They adjusted the nozzles inwards so that despite the curved designed, that would otherwise spray your whole body (making the head pretty awesome), it all just sprays straight like a normal flat head would.  The curved design is aesthetic only, and therefore doesn't make any sense to me.  I think it is wasted potential and somewhat misleading.",210,10,0,13

Not sure when manufactures stopped using words to describe how to put things together or install but the pictures didn't make the installation any easier.  The hardest part of installing the faucet was removing the old one but once I removed the garbage disposal and made room to get behind the sink the installation went very smoothly.

Kindle_Store_5,4.0,1,"Dangerous Territory is an intriguing and exciting romance that takes you into the heart of the war in Afghanistan and into the heat of battle.  Grace Grainger is a journalist and a very good one.  She chooses to spend her time reporting on the lives of those who defend their country, living with them, much like her own tour of duty and is actually ""embedded"" into the team she is with.  Air Force Master Sergeant Josh Travers is a Pararescue Jumper and has done more than his share of tours overseas.  Both of them fantasize about the hot night they had with a stranger several years in the past, and both find themselves very surprised when in the heat of battle, the Pararescuer that comes to save the group Grace is with is the same hottie she got nasty with 3 years ago.

Thrown together in the middle of Afghanistan, the chemistry between these two is undeniably electric, despite the circumstances they find themselves in.  Then, there is the fact that Josh ""hates"" reporters, which presents a different problem.  The danger, drama, and romance in Dangerous Territory will keep you on the edge of your seat, while you fan your face from the heat that isn't even coming from the desert.

While I read the first two books, I didn't really care for the rest of the story. The first one was really good, but the second one was really bad. There was no real story to it.

I did get a little frustrated with the hero and heroine, but I didn't really care about them. I think that they were all just a bunch of idiots.

I really liked the hero, and I really liked the heroine. She was a strong heroine who had a lot of issues. She was a bit naive at the beginning, but she grew on me as the book progressed.

I really liked the villain, and he was a good guy. He was a bit of a jerk, but I didn't care about him.

I really liked the ending. I was hoping that there would be a sequel. It didn't really happen.

I did like the other characters, but I didn't like the ending. I would have liked to have had more characters.

The unit shipped with two parts broken that will require them to replace the entire unit.  We'll see how they handle that and I'll update my review.  It is also missing two pieces.  And when I looked back at my old dreamhouse I found that two things that were broken on this one were broken on that one two and I just never noticed that they were supposed to light up (the fridge light and the fireplace light).

The elevator still doesn't work right.  The cords on both elevators are an inch too short to actually go through the guides, and the clip holding it on at the top comes off every time it is used.  I assume this is a problem with every unit since two units 3 years apart had the problem.

The new hottub doesn't light up like the old one did.  But this isn't a big deal.

The assembly takes about 20 minutes if you are adept at putting things together and reading VERY POOR instructions.  I have assembled thousands of things from toys to furniture to things at work and these are sub-par.  The only real complaint is the sheet of stickers which you have to put on in a very exacting way and which should have been factory applied.  There is no excuse for not simply having the machines that built the house do this step and it means that most of us will have imperfect looking finished products.

I could not put this book down. I devoured it in a matter of an hour and a little bit, and it blew my mind. Devlin is by far one of my favorite male leads of anything Ive read this year. Hes strong, smart, sensitive and tough. Hes been held prisoner for years, but some seriously nasty villains, and despite torture and terrible things happening to him, he remains true to himselfa healer not a fighter. Which just makes me so happy.

Jamie is another great character, she grew on me pretty steadily throughout the novel. I really love their chemistry together, and the fact that the female character was the stronger in the relationship. Devlin is not an alpha malebut it works so well with Jamie who pulls him out of everything and works to make their world better. This is the fourth book in a series, but it didn't feel like I was coming into the story mid-way. Characters from previous books show up and are mentioned but theres enough context to determine who is who without giving away their stories.",197,13,0,10

Movies_and_TV_5,5.0,1,"This is a charming movie with a great soundtrack and superb acting by Mel Gibson and Marisa Tomei.  Gibson reaches a peak of comedic genius in the movie, playing funny and compassionate moments with equal skill.  Although the movie's premise is rather absurd--a man who can hear women's thoughts after accidentally electrocuting himself in the bathroom--the viewer suspends disbelief and is drawn into the plot.  Marisa Tomei is hilarious as the ditzy coffee shop girl.  Delta Burke and Valerie Perrine, as well as Bette Midler, all have minor roles and are great in them.  Mark Feuerstein as Gibson's buddy is also excellent.  Some of the funny lines get a laugh from me every single time I watch (e.g., ""The poodle give you that one?"").  I loved the music, which included songs by Frank Sinatra, Bobby Darin, Cole Porter, and more.  This is a romantic comedy, and although I find it hard to see Helen Hunt as a vulnerable, romantic leading lady--I think of her more as the sardonic character in ""Mad About You""--I thought she acted well in the movie and even worked in some ""cupcake""-type moves.  This is a DVD whose extra features are worth watching, particularly director Nancy Meyers' comments on how the movie was made.  This movie is a keeper that marries the modern dilemmas of romance with the feel of romantic comedies from the 40s and 50s.  Mel Gibson's dance scene and the scene where he waxes his leg are outstanding, and he is entirely believable as the chauvinistic playboy who is shocked at what women think.

One thing I didn't realize before purchasing was EXACTLY how one got the photos on the frame.  I saw the option to insert a memory card so I assumed there would  be a USB cable for transfer.  This isn't the case.  You need to put the photos on the memory card.  I didn't have a card reader, so I went to Wal-Mart and bought a 'holder' for my 4GB card for [..].  That essentially turned it into a 4GB USB memory stick.  Now I just plug that into my computer, add photos, and return it to the frame.  I enjoyed the included Kodak software.  It made it fast and easy to edit my pics, but it caused some incompatibility issues and I had to delete it.  If it will work for you, it is well worth installing.  I use my regular graphics program now.  The frame screen size of 5X7 sounds smallish, but actually is just fine.  We have it on a stand that is only about 4 ft. from the one chair and maybe 10 ft. from the other that we use regularly and the frame can be viewed fine.  We can also see pics easily as we walk past this area repeatedly.  I love that we can see our pics all the time now (or from 1p to 9P with the built in timer).  Before I would have to sit at the computer and look at them, which is nice too, but I seldom did it.

But my laughter quickly turned to intrigue as I realized that this could be exactly what I've been looking for to clean my toddlers sippy cups! So I went ahead and ordered a pair and hoped for the best. I am happy to report that they have become my best friend in the kitchen! You see, sippy cups have all of these little crevices in the tops which traps milk particles, dishwasher residue, etc. Also, if you don't find a lost toddler cup in time, the dried up drink inside can prove to be a real pain to remove. Normally I wrap a soapy dishcloth around a butter knife and get in the crevices and deep into the cup that way. Well no more!! These gloves have eliminated so much work and so many dirty dishcloths for me! They fit just perfectly, and the fact that one is a regular glove allows for easy handling of dishes. The sponge side is what does the trick for the crevices and the bottom rims of the cups, and the scrubby side has made removing dried up milk and chocolate syrup a breeze! I wish someone had thought of these sooner ! 5 stars!!

I installed these tubes on two of my bikes so far but haven't had a chance to go for a long ride yet. But I didn't have any problems with installation. I removed the original tubes and installed these and I used one of the ORIGINAL tubes as a spare in case I do have a flat. I would not use one of these as a spare as they are about the weight of three regular tubes combined.

 I have a Burley trailer that uses 20x1.75 tubes and even ordered tubes for it as I don't want any flats. And even if I do these are so thick that I could probably run the tires flat and still keep going.

I was leary about ordering these at first but at this time I am very please with this product. Just take your time and make sure that the tire seats itself properly on the rim and I would recommend these to others and I will also update my review of them after I get some miles on these tubes.

Since these tubes are so thick and heavy it might take some more effort to pedal because of the rotational force that is involved. I don't think I would use these on my road bike because of that. But for the commuter bike that I plan on riding to work (7 miles one way) or the bike for pulling by trailer it won't matter that much to me. I don't want to fix a flat.

The senors on these lights are in the center and work no matter how they are plugged in. I like to use mine in the top receptacle, leaving the bottom one free for plugging in other things. This also makes the 3 way switch easily accessible from the top. Yes!!! I did say 3 way switch! You have the options of two brightness settings, and can turn the unit off without unplugging it. This is so very handy for me because I work nights and don't need to leave things lit up while I am at work. If you want access to the top receptacle, and don't need easy access to the switch, you can flip it over and plug it into the bottom. Easy!!! The ""HIGH"" setting really lights up my bathroom for those nocturnal visits. I never liked to turn the lights in in there if I am half-awake and plan on jumping back in bed after the deed is done.

Some people may not like being able to see the separate LEDs glowing in the ring, but I find it to be very decorative. I also like the bluish glow they give out much better than a glaring white or yellow light.

Desperate to help her father and save his life, Margaret is assured by her best friends grandfather that she has the special ability to do so.

Charlies grandfather, Joshua Garrett, has a complicated history with Victory and the coal mining company that founded it. The Garrett family moved to the dry desert climate of Arizona to alleviate young Prestons asthma, but when Frederic Garrett went to work in the mine, the family began to experience another form of hardship and danger. Frederic Garrett and his friend Aristotle Agrippa, along with many other miners, take on Victory Fuels, but the cost is high.

Decades later, their actions result in John OMalleys conviction.  The secret, both OMalley family and Joshua Garrett kept, is that they are able to time-travel. Grandpa Joshua hopes that sending Margaret back in time to the moment his friend Luke Agrippa becomes the hard-hearted Lucas Biggs will save her father and rectify past wrongs.  But Grandpa Joshua and Charlie quickly learn that trying to change the past is not enough, so they turn their attention to find a plan to save Lucas Biggs

The threatening execution of John OMalley subsidizes the story with painful strain, but hopefulness, and ethics in standing up for what is right, resisting corruption makes up for that tension and pain. Despite the OMalley ability to time-travel, the elements of fantasy are actually kept to a minimum, bringing the story to a factual resolution. The story starts with these questions and takes readers on an exciting adventure within the heart of several genuine characters.",304,12,0,1

Not a sleep in bed with you kind of toy, the exterior fur is what makes them charming.  Trixies mouth is open so her cute little tongue is showing, which makes her extra authentic appearing.

Trixie arrives in bright purple, pink and blue packaging with a remote control, star glasses and her skateboard.  Even her handkerchief around her neck is purple based delight.  Screams GIRL TOY.  2 AAA batteries and 3 AA batteries are required to make Trixie come to life are NOT included.

She's a little dog, the size of a chihuahua, and light enough for a four year old to carry around.  Younger than that, which is not recommended, may drop and hurt their foot or if they roll onto it bump their head as she's got a hard interior.  Her fur is soft.  Her tongue, eyes, and nose are hard plastic.

Her bark comes in through the remote control which is kind of weird.

The remote is easy to use, just two buttons.  30 tricks- um not really, but after a few the child moves on anyways.  The skateboard moved easily on my marble floors and struggled a bit on carpet.

There were familiarity as well as twists and turns with several shocks tossed into this stew.  At times I said to myself how could they do that or why change the original storyline?

At the end as the credits began and that music which we all knew so well, I said to myself that was exciting.  It all made sense.

There were some very sad scenes.  There were many heroic moments in the face of  death.

The Enterprise was a marvel to behold.  You could see how over four hundred federation representatives could fit on this flagship.

The actors did a noble job of living up to the legends with some twists.  The love interest was, well, you have to see it for your self.

If you go see this with a lot of Star Trek lore tucked away in your brain, be prepared to be unnerved.  If you know little of the original series or films, then this should give you a good introduction to the mythology which has been a part of our culture for the last 43 years.

Kindle_Store_5,1.0,1,"I couldn't finish. It was painfully one-dimensional to me: the reader was told how to feel about every character and situation from the beginning (I tried to let it slide, because beginnings can be rocky even with great stories).
Fav part was when the Hero was talking to an evil henchman, and he yells, ""How much are they paying you?"" And the henchman replies some amount that means nothing to me, and the Hero says, ""It's not enough,"" and flies into a confident, low-stakes martial-arts butt-kicking, somehow never revealing his face. It might actually be cooler and more believable the way I described it. So cheesy!
Then I got bored: erotic dreams of characters who have no emotional attachment to each other doesn't interest me at all, especially because I'm not attached to either of these characters. I was rolling my eyes about their lusty waking inner-monologues, too. And then our Hero was thinking about masturbating on and off for three pages and there's no chance of this ever feeling romantic to me.

The color matches my old aluminum door perfectly and it took my 4.5 month old puppy learned to use it in about 5 minutes. He really seems to love it. MOST IMPORTANT: unless you have a brand new sliding door and live in Southern California, plan on buying different weather stripping. I used expanding weather seal tape made by M-D (http://www.amazon.com/M-D-Building-Products-03100-Compressible/dp/B007NG6IJ6) on all the sides and top of the panel and it solved the gapping/draft issues (my aluminum sliding door is about 70 years old and it's not exactly still square). You could also use a less expensive foam weather seal tape, but I think this one seals/insulates much better in extreme temperatures. My puppy is tall (labradoodle) and about 35 pounds right now and I'm glad I got the extra large door because it will accommodate his growth and gives him extra height for jumping in while he's little and awkward. When you measure for the panel, the total height should include the recessed space of the track where the door fits. I measured wrong: the entryway height of my door is about 80 inches, but the height including the recessed track (where the door fits) is about 82 inches (which is not a standard size) so this didn't quite fit.

It talks about the mindset of war and aggression and how that war crimes are just part of that mindset. Killing hordes of enemy civilians doesn't seem to be a bad idea in the grander picture of things. It seems like we never learn from our mistakes.

Books_5,4.0,1,"The Spindlers has all the right ingredients. The hero forced to descend into another world to accomplish a difficult quest. So many touches are just right; the rat as Betraying Woman, the nocturni as Supernatural Advisors, etc., etc. The nocturni are especially nice, but many of her other features, for me, kind of creak. They're a bit familiar. Need to pass through three chambers to rescue someone? Gee, who's had to do that recently? Since L. Frank Baum and Dorothy rescued the Royal Family a zillion years ago in the Road to Oz. Oh, it was Harry & Co, wasn't it?

Of course, none of that matters, because the formula, the Monomyth, is just that, a formula. It's supposed to be a formula. We don't want it messed with and changed.

But we do want it to be fresh. And The Spindlers just doesn't feel very fresh. Or authentic. Our hero was just...too nice. Her relationship with her brother was just not quite plausible to me, nor did she seem to be...interesting enough to warrant being a hero. No, this book is not Coraline. It lacks the sharp, harsh humor which lends reality to newly created worlds. Too bad, because some of her inventions were vivid. The rat with no friends, the nocturni.

The two main characters, Maisie and Marguerite, are young and inexperienced soldiers who are sent to China in search of a place to live and to train for war.

Talon and Gretchen's book was a wonderful read. The characters are well thought out and all blend together to form a great story.

While there, she meets Talon and the sparks fly from there. I would recommend this book to those that like reading a paranormal/shifter type series with familiar characters but who also like books that you don't have to necessarily read in order.

No, not when Mattel is being greedy. I made the mistake of buying almost everyone of these kits. God Help Me!  I got completely ripped off. They are cheap, the wigs look like crap, the arms and legs are loose, and the hip joints break with little movement. I cant believe that Mattel has gotten so cheap. I mean first the first set of MH dolls end up breaking like crazy, then this?  Come on Mattel don't you have enough money????? Do you really have to rip off us parents this close to Christmas????  This set was NOT worth the money, and I didn't pay hardly anything for it at the store. None of these sets are worth a flip. I might as well toss them ALL in the trash or had just set my dollars on fire in the store. I will be very cautious in buying ANYTHING new from Mattel that is MH. So parents just beware. If you buy any of these kits just know that you are getting half of what you pay for, if that. What is next?  A pile of crap with the MH logo on it?  Really Mattel, really?  This set is even worse than the others and I bought them all unfortunately! The wings won't stay on, none of the torsos look good with any of it.

Books_5,4.0,1,"When I first started this book, it was just not engaging at all.  Something about the writing style and the very slow start really distracted me and kept me from being interested.  It definitely picked up somewhere in the middle and builds up from there finishing with a very satisfying ending.  Not that it matters all that much, but this book has one of the best endings I've read in a while.
Though the story is very slow at times and pretty repetitive at others, some of the concepts in it are really cool and unique (for me at least).  Things like time dilation, major cultural and societal changes to the human race over time, physics, and economics all play pretty large roles in the book.  These are very well explained and really engage the reader, causing one to think about them in a way not really presented in many sci fi books of the genre.  Another thing I enjoyed was the fact that this novel kind of envelopes two recurring themes that are popular in contemporary literature; space warfare\travel, and futuristic dystopian fantasy.  While you are shown intense, high speed warfare in distant galaxies, the earth and its people are undergoing some massive changes and not all for the better.  It is definitely kind of an interesting dichotomy that once again sets this book apart from many others for me.
Over all, the only detracting factor that I can find in The Forever War is its slow start.  The characters are strong, though not completely fleshed out, the setting(s) are really interesting and distinct and the actually story from start to finish is awesome.  It's a relatively short read too so definitely give it a chance and see it through to the end if you can. I doubt you'll regret it.",302,14,0,9

Their version for the 9. 7"" model is attractive, light, but well-engineered, useful, and protective like all the UAG cases I own. I like the dark blue because it isn't another all black case but it isn't an overly flashy color either. I like to cruise just under the radar but still have some style. ;)

Functionally, the case fits well, all ports and buttons are easy to access, it is well protected both opened and especially when closed, and the FrogSkin cover is easy to grip and simple to clean. The cover is easily adjustable and the stand can be detached, it is compatible with a keyboard, it has a ""Smart"" cover to put the device in sleep mode, and there is a stylus holder (see photo). It is fairly light given it's size and doesn't add as much bulk as one might think to your iPad Pro. All in all, this is another fantastic case/cover from UAG.

Books_5,3.0,1,"Macy is bored of all the pitiful looks she receives due to her fathers death a year earlier. She and her mother have been getting along fine, just fine, on their own. Her mother constantly works, and Macy helps her by sticking to their routine and keeping a perfectly clean house. Shes content with her perfect boyfriend and perfect grades and perfect life. That is, until a hectic catering company enlists her help at one of her mothers work parties. She then realizes how exciting chaos can be and how interesting real friends are. I read this book for my Read-a-Thon at school and I finished it in the day. It contains some serious issues, but overall its an airy read. The issues aren't heart-wrenching nor are they abnormal, so the book is easy to relate to. I could complain about its predictability or sappiness, but The Truth about Forever is defintely a book about the journey. It doesnt matter that the reader knows within the first chapter that Macy will fall for the gorgeous catering guy, Wes. Or that the book will have pages about finding yourself, realizing happiness, and moving on. I knew coming into the novel this wasn't a heavy book, which is why I enjoyed it. Its entertaining, and thats why I like Dessens books. Always, she writes books that serve to entertain and relate to teens. I flipped happily through the pages, never bored, but never thrilled either. The characters are fun and normal and don't have anything special about them. Her books are so realistic. The world isn't going to end and the characters don't have anything life altering happen to them. She somehow writes about ordinary days but still engages the reader wholeheartedly. The Truth about Forever is a cute romance between two teens trying to find themselves. The plot isn't extraordinary, but the writing style and characters really make the book.

Gap, Lucky Brand,Express,Saks, Macy's,seriously if they are known for their jeans have been there. Who is shaped that way.? A mid-rise jean is not 10 inches from your crotch to your waist? Legs so tight they all wound up inside out , crotch up on the dressing room floor! Sorry to the help but when the leg openings are so tight I am wrestling them off they can untangle the wretched things. The mid-rises hit half way up my back! I am 65 years old so white jeans are very tricky. These are perfect. I hate paying this much for a single pair of jeans but I am NOT sending these back as I expected to.. Good weight and still not see through? I thought they were going to be lightweight and they are but not too thin/thick. The rise is a perfect 8 inches/zipper 4 inches and the leg openings allow someone with a calf muscle to move  and they don't ride up. I've had them on about 3 hours now and yeah they stretch out a little but in a good way. I can sit cross legged on my bed w/o discomfort! But these jeans! I don't care what color just get a pair before these sell out. I may buy another color myself. I tried to get a shot of my ass in but it wouldn't download!

I think it is worth cautioning readers that are sensitive to the issue of rape that a central element of the story is a woman dealing with her feelings after such an event. The heartbreak and turmoil of such medieval pillaging is part of the nature of Saxon attacks on a rural Roman villa in England. The tale is of love and triumph but real in the brutal reality of the period.

With the death of the men of the farm, the women are left to survive and go on living. They struggle to survive from meager food stuffs while rival powers exert influence on the villa women.  The story has sad elements but Diana, the eldest surviving daughter of the land owner, captures your heart with her courage.

The top goes on super easy and using the pressure cooker is as simple as reading the instructions.  Cooks great.  The rubber gasket should be replaced annually and knowing T-fal for a quality company, I am sure that the gasket will be available for a long time.

While portions of the pressure cooker are dishwasher safe, I will probably just continue to wash it by hand.",148,8,0,9

But, sometimes what you wished for is not as dear as what finds you by mere ""mortal means."" And when issues of life and death enter the picture, Heather's view of what is important radically changes, bringing into focus what truly matters.

I recently hunted down a reprint as I had lost a large volume of my original reads and re read the book. The story is a light fantasy read, but extremely entertaining. The plot and characters are creative, and the writing is descriptive and enjoyable. Lawrence portrays the main character as distinctly human in his attributes and flaws which is a breath of fresh air from other novels. Presenting a character that could be you or me or anyone, thrust into an adventure unwillingly and forced to play the cards as fate deals them. I also enjoy Lawrence' very non-linear and unorthodox story lines. He's very creative with coming up with non-traditional fantasy elements and weaving them together into a very solid story. You can see more of this in his other novels such as ""cyborg and the sorcerers"", or the overman series, but also here as well. I recommend this novel to anyone.",179,11,0,9

I was packed, turned it on and then NOTHING but the Magellan intro screen hanging there. System reset did not fix anything, and then it turned itself off.  In short, this a defective unit after three years of only occasional use. I stopped at a Walmart on the way of my trip and chose a TomTom Start 40M, which is a very nice unit that was up and running in 5 minutes.

I switched to them as I couldn't clean the plastic litter boxes completely of odor, and in my small home that's an important consideration.

These are the BOMB - very strong, holds two bags of 18 lb Dr. Elsey's litter at a time (that's how my cats and I like it ;), and the cardboard sides allow the litter to stay drier.  Getting clumps off the walls is easier compared to plastic bins, likely due to the drying effect.  After a month, I bin the entire shebang (one box for two cats lasts an entire month).  I've also used the smaller ones when I travel with my cats.  The boxes are reasonably-priced, and I usually get them from my local Pet Club - but am extremely grateful I can find them for the same price on Amazon with Prime Shipping when my local Pet Club is out of stock.

I really like this universe (multiverse?), but there are so many characters and so much about the world(s) that is hinted at it becomes a bit overwhelming.  Unless you have read the whole series and have the background.

That being said, for those of you who are fans this adds a wonderful new group of magic users to the mix.  Having some new blood to add to the already defined groups should shake things up nicely.  We also see more action by mage compass's, which is a nice change from the usual witches pyramids.  Some of the first hints of a coming tech/magic revolution that may make the industrial revolution look like a minor upgrade.  A whole new pyramid also is peeking around the edges.

Now for the bad:  Much as I like this world ^and^ the writing, this is not a good short story.  This is more of a chronology of what happened.  While some of the characters learned new skills or information, we did not.  More about filling in the blanks and backstory than developing a character.

There is a teaser at the end of the book showing the next(?) in the series that gives me a lot of hope.  The Sea Kings!!  An almost unexplored area.

The problem I have with the company is their misleading use of the term ""LIMITED lifetime warranty"". Let me explain. Streamlight's ""LIMITED lifetime warranty"" doesn't apply to electronics, bulbs, batteries, or switches, just to what they deem as manufacturer's defects. So, basically, their so-called warranty applies only to manufacturing defects in the aluminum body-tube of the light. NOT COOL, Streamlight... you want us to ""Buy American"", but you have a crappily designed switch that wreaks of designed obsolescence.

UPDATE: After using these for a few nights, I discovered that two of them had moved on the hard hat. I don't know if it was the freezing temps outside, or the hot temps sitting on the dash in the truck. Whatever the reason, I had to replace the tape on one of them. The tape they use it not the same VHB tape that I have. And I have 3M VHB, right out of the box, that I have used for years, so I know mine is legit.) These are not good for hard hat use. Two Cons...The holders are flat. There really is no flat spot on a hard hat, so there will be a small space along the edge that will not adhere to the surface. Its why Go Pro makes curved helmet mounts. Its a big deal, because enough of the VHB tape does make contact. Also, the holders are two different sizes. There is no instruction as to which goes where.

Kindle_Store_5,5.0,1,"I have had to honor of receiving this book from the author for an honest review.  With Every Heartbeat was such a sweet story. I immediately fell in love with Annalise and Raphael!
  Annalise ate, sleep, and breathed to dance. Ballet is her life, every since her mother put her in her first pair of ballet slippers, she could not focus on anything else. Her mom had been a dancer, and she was following in her footsteps.
  Going to Rome with the American Ballet Company was an honor. Fighting for prime solo spots, training hard, and focusing on nothing else. Until she walked away from the group on afternoon that is.... Stumbling across a group of street dancers may have changed her life for good.
  One look at Raphael and she knew she was in trouble. There was something about the way he danced, so free, so alive... and those eyes!! Although she knew it was wrong, that she was risking everything, she continued to sneak away to meet him, just to melt in those eyes, in those strong arms.
  Agreeing to dance with Raphael she had to train her body to move differently. Years and years of ballet dancing could not have prepared her to be able to dance with a partner like him. She is falling in love, and she can't stop herself.
  After finding Raphael dancing with his old partner, Annalise is undeniably heartbroken. Not giving him a chance to explain, she runs. Beats herself over and over for being so naive and stupidly denying the training she needs for her once in a lifetime performance.
  The story of Annalise and Raphael is heart gripping. I loved reading how their story played out and how their love for music was engrained in every step they took in life. The book did remind me a lot of a movie I've seen... American girl meets hot young Italian, who sweeps her off her feet! How can you go wrong!? SWOON!

Electronics_5,4.0,1,"I'm very disappointed in this drive, as even with large files I can't write faster than 80MB/sec on a USB 3.0 port. But I don't think it's the drive's fault, as it's capable of much faster speeds and other people get those speeds.

The issue with these very fast USB 3.0 drives is that their speed is very much affected by the chipset being used, and the chipset drives. I am using a 2yr-old ASUS motherboard and it uses the ASMedia USB 3.9 chipset. It's a highly regarded chipset but it came out after the NEC/Renasys (sp?) and drivers seem optimized for the latter.

The odd thing is that I bought a 32 GB SanDIsk Extreme (not the Pro version, as this is new) last year and it's blazingly fast on the same port on the same computer, so I would have expected this to be at least that fast.

One thing to mention: These are expensive drives and the 32 GB Extreme was and still is expensive. The competition 3.0 drives have dropped but not the SanDisk Extremes, which I think is fair as they are so much faster. (I have a couple of other brands USB 3.0 flash drives and they are laughably slow compared to the SanDisks.)  However, what stunned me about the Extreme series, given the price, was how incredibly cheaply made they are. They are made of the crummiest plastic you can imagine and I'm sure I could squeeze and shatter it pretty easily.

With this new Extreme Pro series, there's still some of that, and these are far more physically delicate drives than other brands (esp given the price) but they don't feel quite as delicate as the Extreme series.",286,18,0,11

He is always a bit stubborn with it and it has held up well.  I think it has held up well to a few pull ups.  I'm really pleased with it.This is a great product for dogs that need something to keep them occupied. I love that it is made in the USA. My dog has a lot of separation anxiety and this one has worked out great. It is a bit thick and doesn't take up a lot of room. It is easy to put on and it is comfortable for my dog. I have used it for a while now and it is very well made and very durable.Works great.Our dog loves them and is happy.My cats love these.  My dog is about 15 lbs.  He was very picky about his food so I would give this a try.  It's not a big deal and we feed our pets anything.  He eats it pretty much every day and it's a nice change of pace.  He has been eating it a lot and is enjoying the taste of it.  I'm sure he'll like it even more if he grows into a bigger dog.This is a nice little fountain, and the cats love it!  They love it too!

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,1,"As you can see from the photo, this bra is nothing special as far as looks go. It's not the bra that I would wear under my t-shirts when I'm out and about (because it doesn't flatter me as much as my favorite underwires), but it's great for giving me much-needed support when I'm home taking it easy and it's a great value for the price. A lot of women prefer to go braless at home, but, if you're like me and want/need support during all waking hours, this may very well be the bra for you. The wide under-band doesn't provide as much support as my Bali underwires but I found it to be adequate. I guess you can say that it strikes a happy medium between industrial strength support and going braless. I ordered this bra at the lower end of my regular band size - in other words, I generally wear a 38 or a 40 so I chose the 38 - because I figured that it should fit snug in order to be supportive. Once I got the bra and tried it on, I was glad I ordered that way because I'm sure it's going to stretch out a bit over time and, by ordering snug, I'll get better support for a longer period of time. I ordered it in my regular cup size and that worked out fine. The shoulder straps are comfortable and the hooks are strong and secure. I don't usually order bras online unless I am already familiar with the fit, but I went into this purchase with the idea that it was going to function as a house bra and I was not too concerned with how it looks; I just wanted one that doesn't have wires and feels nice and comfortable with just enough support.

Books_5,5.0,1,"I love this story. All the characters and the experiences really hit me. My heart hurt when the characters were in pain and I was so happy when they were experiencing joy. I love that you become immersed and invested in all the minor characters. You want to know about them and what's going on with them through their Wishwell experience.

I loved Maddy so much. On the surface she's just a regular privileged teen but through the relationship she has with her neighbor Rachel and her family you see that she's so much more than that. She's smart and strong even when she's sad and weak.

I loved the moments in between the family. This family is full of completely different people with completely different personalities but they are all united through their love for Astrid. You can tell that each one of them would drop everything for Astrid, and that's exactly what they do when they head out on this Wishwell trip.

Movies_and_TV_5,3.0,1,"I had fun watching ""Bad Teacher."" It's not a great film by any means, and I don't plan on repeated viewings, but it was enjoyable to watch once.

What's interesting about the film is that it's about a character that is completely morally reprehensible, and yet still comes across as likable. Much of this probably has to do with Cameron Diaz, who is just such a likable actress. She's a beautiful woman with a knockout figure and a mega-watt smile, and yet she's so goofy and willing to make fun of herself that even when she's playing nasty characters it's hard not to find her charming.

And boy is this character nasty. She's greedy, she's lazy, and she's selfish. She lies, she steals, she manipulates. What's also interesting is that the storyline of the repugnant central character, Elizabeth, does not fall into either of the two clichs that you'd expect from a Hollywood film:

1) She does not end up finding herself inspired by the children and discover a love of teaching, revealing a heart of gold hidden beneath her prickly exterior.

2) She does not find herself getting her comeuppance for being such an awful human being.

If anything, the characters in the film who are depicted as truly pathetic are Elizabeth's sincere, hardworking fellow teachers. Is this a dubious message? Perhaps. But the performers are all so funny and likable (Lucy Punch and Justin Timberlake are both hilarious) that they manage to make up for the film's many flaws.",251,15,0,2

Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,1,"I have had dogs for over 30 years and have used a wide variety of crates. I currently own the larger MidWest iCrate, a larger 'generic brand' crate, this size in 'generic brand', and an extra large all steel crate, along with many airline style travel crates.

When I recently acquired a new 4 pound puppy, the MidWest iCrate was my first choice in new crates to buy for him.  The 24 inch size is ideal for this size puppy and the 12 pound dog he will grow into.  The crate is NOT meant to be used for a puppy that is going to grow into a very big dog (such as a Golden Retriever or Labrador).  It is just not sturdy enough for a big, strong willed puppy.  In that case, get the crate the puppy will need as an adult and use the barrier the comes with it to divide it when the pup is little.

This crate is meant for a small dog, therefore a small puppy. And for that, it is perfect.  The double set of doors allows you to set it up in a variety of locations and still have access for the pup.  We currently have it set up lengthwise with the side door left open for easy access.  The puppy can come and go as he pleases to access his pee pads at night in the kitchen, and then return to his crate to sleep.  He LOVES his crate and willingly runs to it at night to lay down and sleep while we babygate him in the kitchen. When compared to the generic crate that I have, the MidWest crate is made from a higher gauge wire, it assembles together tighter, and it just seems sturdier overall. The plastic pan is a heavier weight and is holding up well.

I definitely plan on always using MidWest crates in the future.",317,16,0,8

Pet_Supplies_5,1.0,1,"I have to blame myself. I knew when I first looked at it after my girlfriend ordered it - not as secure as our existing harness. Dog can't slip out by pulling forward, but if he freaks out and spins and pulls backward, it could happen. I KNEW it could happen.

It did happen - in the middle of Hollywood.

He was freaked out by a noise, was spinning in circles, slipped out and ran away - ran around a huge block, me in futile pursuit (he runs like a greyhound,) crossed 2 busy streets twice (Yucca and Wilcox) and almost went to Hollywood Blvd. Somehow he survived and this story has a true Hollywood ending... apparently a taxi driver had just let out a fare and my little guy jumped in - only way he could've gone in was on his own. Driver waved me up the street, ""He's here!"" Pointed to his yellow mini-van/taxi. I thought he meant he was hiding underneath - no, he was locked in the back seat.

I had 2 large dogs for over a decade, always had them on either a choker or a secure harness, to avoid my greatest fear of them getting loose. Never happened, they both passed away recently within 6 months of each other. Found this little guy in between, almost lost him because of this harness. Yes - it was on snug. It's not a secure design. Look at it!

I opened the package to find a loose zipper pull falling out at me and I couldve just ended my review there. Based on the other reviews, Im not the only person that received a flawed item out of the box. Id be wary of it and Id be wary that the other zipper pulls won't last. My internal zipper for the liner on the side of the handle also was missing a zipper pull altogether.

In terms of actually using the Pescadero to travel, it does reasonably well and holds itself up as a four-wheel spinner should, including its telescoping handle. I took it on a car trip, which is probably as much as I care to trust it. I like that its lighter than other 20-inchers Ive used before, although you can pay a premium for lighter weight specs if you choose elsewhere.

However, for flying, I don't like that it doesnt have any other exterior access compartment, nor does it have a TSA lock and no internal pockets. For a hard-shell exterior, its less rigid compared to my current hardshell. I can push the exterior in too easily with my hand alone.

Books_5,5.0,1,"Year of the Unicorn is my favorite Witch World novel among the many five-star novels in this series by Lifetime Grand Master of Fantasy, Andre Norton (Alice Mary North).  Each setting, each character is illuminated with clear description and color, like scenes from a medieval Book of Hours.  Even though I first read this book in 1965, I can still close my eyes and see Gillan and the ancient Dame Alousan gathering herbs in the high-walled garden of Norstead Abbey.  I can see the twelve and one high-born maids riding forth from the Abbey  the twelve and one maids who were promised as brides to the Were-riders of the Waste.

The heroine, Gillan realizes that she is not meant for the quiet life of her vowed companions.  She possesses a magic that is forbidden to the goodly Dames, and a restless curiosity that is stifled behind the stone walls of the Abbey.  And so she rides forth, disguised as the bride who had threatened to kill herself rather than marry a Were-rider.  In order to survive, Gillan must rely on her unschooled magic to separate illusion from reality, and true love from the snarling masks of the Were pack.

Year of the Unicorn is a grand adventure, a love story, a coming-of-age novel set like a jewel amidst the fantastical Dark and Light of Nortons Witch World. Unicorn veers away from the mainstream WW adventures of the Tregarth family (Witch World, Web of the Witch World, Three Against the Witch World, etc.), but it is perfect in its own setting (the Wastes and Dales of High Hallack), and in its own right.",272,11,0,5

In the beginning of the story she reminisces on how she should have listened to her friends about how bad her ex was and how she wishes she had paid more attention to their opinions at the time and maybe she wouldn't be in the mess she is in....and then she goes and does it again. I just can't support a character that I constantly want to shake some sense into.,83,4,0,3
Home_and_Kitchen_5,3.0,1,"There are several choices when it comes to cooking utensils: Stainless remains my favorite choice given that it is dishwasher safe, sturdy enough to hold up under force, and thin enough that it can easily get under the cooked product. Silicone, also dishwasher safe, has the advantage of being good for teflon-coated pots and pans but the disadvantage of rarely being tapered sufficiently to get under, say, a sunny-side up egg, without damaging the appearance of the food. Bamboo is a great alternative; though you have to hand wash wood utensils, wood is generally stronger than silicone and can still be used in teflon-coated cookware. The trick, though, is that it has to be cut properly.

This set could have used a little more in the finish department. The colored handles are a nice touch, but the half that touches food is rough to the touch, not quite sanded sufficiently, and doesn't come to as thin an edge as is necessary on the spatula tools. Further, the slotted cuts on two of the utensils had left a few bits of little wood splinters that I needed to make sure were thoroughly removed when I first cleaned the items. The wood was also finished with a light outer coating - some type of urethane? - that wasn't smoothly applied. There are areas which lack the coating, and some areas which appear to have blotches and extra coating.

So overall, the set is ok, particularly as a lightweight set for a camp or RV stove, but at home you would likely be better served with two or three higher grade utensils than this set.",272,11,0,3
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,1,"It took me awhile before I really needed it, and it saved my vacation.  Firstly, when I received it (fast shipping) I mounted it under the water bottle cage and it fit in nicely.  Most of my friends didn't even know I had a pump with me.  I stashed all the other goodies in my bag guessing I wouldn't really need them.  I was wrong.  We took a trip to the upper area of Wisconsin in a location where the closest people are 10 miles or more apart.  As luck would have it, we broke down.  The car just stopped and later to find out it was a clogged fuel line.  So off comes bike and I'm ready to roll for help, but oops!  Flat tire!!!  No problem, I have a pump and it would have done a stellar job but I'm afraid it was the tube that burst.  UGH!  Thinking I couldn't do a repair in the woods I was wrong.  I had everything I needed to do the repair.  It was a life saver, because we were more than 20 miles from the nearest help.  The Mini bike pump worked great, I was even able to put in 55psi in my balloons.  Since then I used it just to top off, and it had worked great.  No issues.  Thanks Blanst!

Stand for the test tubes
Measuring Scoops

I had one as a kid and was thrilled when I saw they were remaking these and kept the look of the ones from 20 years ago instead of revamping the look like they do with all the remake toys. Sugar has very soft fur and I love the sparkly strands throughout her purple hair. The stitching on the dog is very well done and it seems durable.

Both of mine had 5 puppies so we were excited about that. Each puppy has a hard vinyl head with a soft body and a pink or blue bow around it's neck to determine if its a girl or boy. The puppies are about 4"" long and Sugar is about 15"" long. My niece's actually had a preemie puppy which was really cool! She was excited that there was a runt in the litter that was slightly smaller than the rest. I do wish the stomach hole in Sugar was a little deeper to accommodate all the puppies a little better but they do fit back in though it's a tight fit.

This is skimpy set. When it is available and I can check it against the actual retail price I may update my rating. But otherwise meh. You only get round track, 3 cars, the controller and some removable decorations--it does have cool noises. I have a Marklin Z scale and an older O gauge by Lionel that I use during christmas time (obviously in different locations because near each other would be pure craziness) so I understand the train prices are more expensive than people realize, especially Engines. And this is a pretty neat and fun for little kids Engine. The Caboose is Bobber style and ok. The engine is a Lion chief Thomas the Tank and is very obviously the highlight of the set. The chirstmas hat makes it that much cuter. The remote is battery power and includes announcements and sounds but no smoke (that i could tell.) The middle freight car is nothing special and feels especially cheap, though to be fair these often do I think in part because of the open top design. The track diameter when fully spaced out is a little over 3 feet. The track is your standard Lionel rack and self stabilizes with the plastic base. With another car and 4-6 pieces of straight track this would be a neat 5 star set. As it is it just feels a little cheap. Lightweight, lots of plastic, not many cars and very small completed track.

I think most kids will love this set, and they can set it up themselves, and make train announcements--my nephew sure did--but I think parents need to understand what they're getting or they'll feel they maybe didn't get their money's worth. Its not quite the grand experience of trains of our youth. Its more plastic, less track, less cars, were bigger and we had to pay for it!",313,21,1,13

I am pretty handy, I have dissembled, cleaned, and reassembled it several times now but it never lasts for long.  The whole system is based on the fact that when you touch it you ground it out, yet there are numerous components below the sink that are not insulated, and if they happen to touch something conductive (like, oh, I don't know, a PIPE?) it renders it useless or triggers it when nobody is around.  I went through several iterations of mounting the batteries up and away, insulating the pipes to prevent the hose/weight from touching etc all to no avail.  In addition, the soap dispenser that came with it is plastic crap, it's not even metal, just a facade that looks like metal, it broke within a few months.

Movies_and_TV_5,4.0,1,"What a wonderful movie this is! The triumph of form over content portrayed with icy precision. Characters acknowledge each other  mostly in terms of self-absorbed one-upsmanship. Surface and ritual reign supreme, indeed characters confuse each other's identities with neither thought nor consequence. Sex, for Patrick Bateman (as probably for all others) is  an expression of vanity and power, nothing more. Patrick Bateman's only moments of true passion and fulfillment occur when he kills. Irony and paradox: does he kill so as to feel alive and vibrant, or does he kill precisely to feed his need to suppress feeling, like an alcoholic drinks to suppress his need for alcohol. Feelings, after all, are messy, not very elegant.  Irony itself conveys a measure of elegance. Thus the movie comments on itself. AmPsy is not really satire. There is no real madness or wackiness here, nor does it carry that element of pratfall, grotesquerie, reality turned inside out to affirm itself, which underly satiric points. It's a disquisition on a decade, a perspective, a way of being that is still very much part of us today. Perhaps now we do it a bit more vulgarly.  There is keen pleasure in realizing that the camera itself, more than words, is the scalpel for the irony which defines this chilly tale. I bet the screenplay is relatively short. Don't miss this film. It's also very funny. You just have to meet Patrick Bateman, a really swell guy.",242,19,1,3

Movies_and_TV_5,4.0,1,"A mother/son road trip movie is sort of an uncharted journey in the film world. That made this a very unique film from the start.. Based on an actual road trip that Fogelman took with his mother is probably what makes the movie so real. Streisand and Rogen have great chemistry and since the movie is 80% just them, that is a godsend. Joyce's constant need to interfere with Andy's life in almost every aspect drives him crazy until an explosion of unexpected drama on the part of mother and son. There are so many funny lines and situations that the theatre was filled with laughter often. The movie could also take a very serious, moving turn which can move you to tears.
 Streisand has always been an actress of immeasurable range from musicals (Funny Girl) to comedy (What's Up Doc?) to drama (The Way We Were) with each type being a blockbuster hit.  In her semi-retirement she works very seldom.  It took them a year to convince her to come back to her first lead role in many years.  Her Joyce is perhaps one of the most real characters she has ever played  Stripped of glamour she wears track shoes and sneakers.  She is just a regular mother who lives for the happiness of her son.  Rogen has rarely played such a straight character as Andy.  Anne Fletcher has brought out the best of them both.  The climatic showdown is pure real dramatic that Streisand delivers with a powerful punch that stuns the audience as much as Andy.
. I liked everything about this film and can't wait to see it again. Don't skip the end because there are a lot of clips after the credits of mother and son banter that is very funny.

Kindle_Store_5,5.0,1,"Combing the mythological stories of the Argonauts, with futuristic genetic manipulation, Kneupper has crafted an exciting sci-fi tale that reimagines an old story in a fantastic new way.
 Following the adventures of Jason, a super-soldier and product of the genetic code enhancements provided by Argo Corp, and genomancer Medea, Argonauts is faced paced, without skimping on immersive world building or short changing the plot.
 Argonauts is well-written clear, clean prose, strong characterization, and page turning action sequences. It is sure to be a welcome addition to the reading shelf of fans of Sci-fi, and bio-genetics in particular.
 My only criticism of this book is that I would have liked to see Medeas personality be a bit stronger. Im assuming shell have a growth arc later on, as it set up well for her to snap out of her lovesick behavior pattern. Her personality made the book read more like a YA to me, which may or may not have been his intention. Either way, could completely be a set up for future installments.",173,8,0,3

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,1.0,1,"Understanding that all wax seals will eventually fail, I researched the alternatives and purchased this Danco seal and a Fluidmaster rubber seal - in case one didn't work properly. The toilet it was to be used with is about a year old and is from the American Standard ""Mainstream"" family.

The floor is tiled and level. The toilet flange is the newest PVC flange that Oatey makes, is ""above the floor"", and level.

The specs on this Danco seal state that it will work with flanges that are ""above the floor"", up to 1/2"" tall.

This seal didn't compress enough to allow the toilet to sit flush with the floor. It just rocked side to side. There was no error with the installation as the toilet was repositioned several times to ensure that a proper ""set down"" onto the Seal was made. There just simply wasn't enough room between the outlet on the bottom of the toilet and the top of the flange for this Seal to fit into.

You know what worked? The cheapie old Harvey wax ring. Prepped and placed the toilet down the first time and flush the toilet sits.

Maybe this Danco Seal works for some combinations of toilets and flange heights - but if you want to save yourself some grief, purchase and have on hand the good ole' wax ring just in case you're in the predicament I was in.

Admittedly, it won't be cheap. Current exchange rate amounts to eighteen bucks plus shipping. But you'll then be able to enjoy one of the classics of science fiction. It predates WarGames by more than ten years, and offers a more realistic--if darker--vision of the future of computer intelligence.

Bag is roomy and will hold all the stuff I need to carry around when we are out and about on vacation.  The 2 side pockets and the top pocket all lock the front two pockets do not lock but they are great for non value things that you need to grab quickly.  The locking clips are a little hard to do at first but once you figure them out it's not a problem.

My only dislike about this bag is the handle strap across the top.  It looks really weird because it sticks out several inches making it look strange when it's on your back & it actually makes it a little unsafe when you have it on since it would be very easy for someone could grab it and pull you over with it.

I emailed Sea Eagle about my issue and had sent them a picture of the hole to which they replied the hole would not be covered under the warranty and there was nothing they would do. So basically I'm left with a useless boat and I just threw it away.

Even though this craft maker claims there is a warranty be very careful you don't damage it because you may be stuck with a whole lot of uninflatable rubber like me.

Also, the foot pump busted after the first use and I just bought a hand pump to use. The boat itself would constantly pull and never tread in a staight line.

The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that the front of the unit is a plastic ""good"" case, but it's a little difficult to open and close. I wish it had a little more padding for the corners. The only thing I wish I had known was that I could use this in a different room or on different floors. But that's not what I expected. I'm not sure if I would be able to use it in my room if I was sitting next to it. I think it would be more useful if I could just turn it on and off. I'm not sure if it would be better to just turn it on and off if I was sitting next to it. But I'll leave that for the next review.

Pet_Supplies_5,2.0,1,"I just received this item today. At first glance, it looks attractive enough. Upon closer inspection, it is a poorly made item. The manufacturers should have put more thought in quality rather than adding two decorative silver bones which adds no function to this item. The stitching is unraveling at the ""leash area."" The ""tag"" stitching also has unraveled. If I were the cynical type, I would say that the supplier knew of the unraveled stitching and tried to glue it back together but it didn't hold. Also the hidden tag is paper under a plastic sleeve. I would never trust my beloved dog to only have this as a tag. It is not waterproof nor is it secure in it's sleeve; The tag is useless. The ""D"" is too bulky, and as others have mention, the extra collar end just hangs there, making the collar look unfinished and shabby. The built-in leash is a great idea, but this item falls short in quality. The leash is made of some stretching rubber (kind of like a car fan belt but not as strong). I predict that this leash will break if used too often, so I am not going to rely on it in public. I'll just use it in the house. I normally would return a product like this but it probably would cost me more in time and money to ship it back, which is probably what the supplier counts on. Buyers, read the reviews carefully, cause the reviews I read were right on. I'll use it for six months, which it what I give it before it's none usable.

Electronics_5,4.0,1,"Let me start off with the packaging.
1. It doesn't say ""Plus"" anywhere on it.
2. The information on the back isn't always correct. It says it has a mini-usb for example when it really has a micro-usb.
3. The packaging looks like something you'd get in a airport vending machine. Not very high end at all.

What is more important is the product itself.
1. It's much lighter than expected. It's a good thing for headphones, but it does make it feel unsubstantial. The diameter is about the size of a silver dollar.
2. The shiny black plastic looks like it will damage easy.
3. The logo in the middle looks like it should be a button. It isn't.
4. The front buttons are easy to access, but the volume buttons on the side are harder to feel.
5. The blue light flashes when it's powered on.
6. It stores in a very small spiral that can be like a puzzle to unravel until you get used to it.
7. Overall it is very comfortable and easy to forget you are wearing. Doesn't fall off easily.
8. USB port is covered by a little rubber flap that isn't very reassuring.

Most important is performance.
1. Bass is underwhelming. Sound is on the tiny side.
2. Connection strength is very good. Easy to walk around the house and not lose connection.
3, You can still easily hear the world around you at normal volumes.
4. Battery lasts as long as advertised and charges quickly.
5. You can still hear the trademark ""bluetooth buzz"" when the sound is low.
6. Microphone isn't very good at hearing you. Constantly had to talk louder than I would have with a phone.

Overall I feel like it is a solid product for the price. Will it win awards in... anything? Probably not, but it is still a great value. I feel it would be a five-star product at $30-35, but at $50 it's still a solid option for small, over-ear bluetooth headphones.

First, the LFE Kit (with Amp) is probably the best choice to start with because you can't drive it from your receiver - not enough power.  So getting in the game will cost you around $500. Which is more than for Aura Bass Shakers, but far better.

Second, one LFE Kit will do a sofa nicely, but if you, like me, mount it under your floor, you're gonna need two.  Possibly more, but probably two.  Because that's a LOT more mass to shake, and otherwise they'll be maxxing out and making a loud knocking noise.

Third, it's not like riding a rollercoaster.  You'll feel the floor shake from loud sound effects, bombs, etc., but don't expect magic.  It makes the movie more real, but it doesn't toss you around.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,1.0,1,"Ignoring common sense and warnings on the Web, I bought one of these hand held Dyson DC34 vacuums for about 4 times what I'd pay for a high end competitor's model (e.g. Black and Decker LiIon model). When I got it, I was initially very pleased: Good suction, worked very well. The battery life is short (maybe 6-7 minutes on a charge), but I knew that going in, and that's just part of the package.

Then, after a number of months, the machine began stopping after a few seconds. It wasn't that the battery wasn't charged: I could use it for a few seconds, have it stop, play games with the unit, get it to run for maybe 20-30 second, have it stop, play more games, and so on to get the full 5-6 minutes out of it. But the unit just failed to run continuously for more than a fraction of a minute. I went online and discovered this is a horribly common problem with this model. I contacted Dyson and had them tell me that the unit was out of its (short) warranty and that I'd need to buy another one.

That's not going to happen. Instead, I'll try to warn you all not to waste your money on this machine that, apparently, has design defects. Instead, get a high end (LiION battery) Black & Decker, or similar model for a quarter of the price. It might not be 100% as good as a vacuum, but it's assuredly 90% as good, and in addition, you'll get a much longer lifetime out of it. And when it dies, you can buy another THREE before you're up to the cost of this piece of poorly designed junk.

Kindle_Store_5,5.0,1,"I received an ARC of this book in exchange for a honest review.

As American as apple pie! I have been getting into Sports romances here lately ever since I read Pucked By: Helena Hunting, while Rage does not have quite the comedic timing it is still an engrossing read. I love baseball, even grew up playing it myself with my friends so I have a soft spot for anything to do with the sport. AJ is the main character and while he's a bit of a hot head he's an awesome player both on the field and off if you catch my drift ;)

Until he hits the major leagues his temper has controlled his career but after a coach takes him under his wing and along the way he introduces  AJ to his granddaughter who is adorable! And leads to me changing my opinion of AJ, he's great with Clair and eventually meets her mother Addison. . . He makes a stellar first impression let me tell you! Acting like a Grade A . . . Well you know haha but he makes a huge turn around.

I really enjoyed this book, the characters were so well done and the author built up enough intrigue and tension between Addison and AJ that it made for a natural progression. Not like some where they meet and within the first couple of chapters they are falling into bed. I like that she was cautious of beginning a relationship because of Clair it made her a good momma which is one of my favorite character traits of hers. There are some twists and turns in this story that I didn't quite anticipate and that made me want to pick up everything Elizabeth writes from now on. I highly recommend this book for those who enjoy sports romances!",306,15,4,16

I expected it to work better than it did. When not fogged the vision is very clear and the fit is nice. I have an average sized nose, but a bit of a larger head, and this fit well.
It is possible that I do not know what I am doing with the treatment before first use, but I think I did things correctly. I want to recommend the mask because everything about it is great except the fogging, and to me that is a huge piece of what I would call a good mask or goggles. So instead I give it 3.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4.0,1,"I collect knives and tried this low priced traditional 'toothpick' from Buck.
Like a number of Bucks knives now, this is made in China, so I'll quickly hit a few potential quality control hot spots:

The jigged bone handle scales: mounted to the frame of the knife with no visible gaps or defects, no problem there. The jigging itself is deep and well defined, not REfined as on a Case knife, but it's low priced (an equivalent Case toothpick would cost you at least 5 times as much.) The bone material seems OK.

The blade: Evenly ground on both sides, came paper-shearing sharp (just shy of hair-shaving.) No defects. Bucks prolific 420HC steel- perfectly decent steel, Buck has a particularly good heat treat in testing. I own the Buck 119 special large fixed blade which uses the same steel.

The bolsters: Nice and glossy, the pins are buffed to near invisibility.

Blade pivot point: The blade snaps open firmly, no play side to side or up and down. It is of course a slip joint blade and does not ""lock.""

Overall, 9/10 for value. A fine choice as a gift, as a light duty every day carry pocket knife, or as a budget ""gentleman's folder"" (I bought it with this latter purpose in mind- it is thin, lightweight, and looks nice.)

I previously had a homemade file server (basically an old 700MHz Compaq PC with two 500GB hdds installed, running Ubuntu Server).  This Dlink just sips the power.  I measured both the old server vs the Dlink DNS-325 using a Kill-a-watt.  Here are my findings:

My old server was using ~ 72.5 W.  The DNS-325 used 8 W (3.5 while asleep).

My old server used 13.96 kWh over 209 hrs.  The DNS-325 used 0.14 kWh over 24.39 hrs.

My old server cost roughly $4.26 per month to operate.  The DNS-325 should cost at most 37 cents.  It will be less than half that if I allow it to sleep.

With my TV I can send the audio wirelessly which worked well, but I chose the optical cable instead. Even with the optical cable the sound bar turns on and off automatically without exception. The sub syncs by itself, and Bluetooth worked great but I only used it when I first opened the box to hear the sound from this bar. One thing I noticed is it was recommended for 43"" and smaller tvs. This may be due to length, however I mounted it in the center of the TV with the included wall mount, and if centered properly it looks perfect. It is pretty loud as well, we usually have the volume between 15 and 25 out of 100.  I have the sub turned down and in a corner behind my couch (it just needs a wall outlet) and also sounds good.  The bar itself adjusts with the TV volume which displays on the TV when adjusted. Basically I never have to touch the sound bar or use it's remote (which is a good thing cause I haven't seen it in a month). One caveat with the wall mount is the optical cable plugs in on one side of the mount than has an opening for the wire to go into the wall on the other side.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,1,"I've read so many forum streams about ""skirt or no skirt"", which toilet is the ""best"" and so on, it too me a few hours to digest all the feedback. However,  I especially wanted a toilet that doesn't give me grief when I clean it. I am very happy, no, I'm ecstatic about this toilet. Yes, it probably cost more than perhaps a standard toilet, but it s finally something that I enjoy cleaning - yes, you read that right ""ENJOY""! It also goes will with our modern bathroom design and we wanted a ""short"" toilet because of space restrictions and this one fit the bill perfectly. It functions fine with the two flush options. And I like that it toilet seat closes slowly :)

Let me give a shout-out to the many people in forums and on Amazon, who helped me with their feedback. It has been exhaustive to read all about toilets (but thankfully most of us don't need to do that very often!),  and it did indeed help us make a decision. We can't be happier with the choice we made - so, thanks everyone!

Price on Amazon was very competitive and it arrived in two pieces. Our contractor hadn't installed one of these yet, and it was different to what he was used to. But it seemed to be quite easy!

Does not come with a toilet seat, but this one works nicely for us: TOTO SS114-01 Transitional SoftClose Elongated Toilet Seat, Cotton White.",248,15,4,19
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,1,"I seems odd to get all excited about a booklight, but this is honestly the best booklight I have ever owned and I have gone through a lot of them, being an insomniac night reader with an early-bedtime husband.

The most excellent feature on this little light is the very high quality metal gooseneck. It will move absolutely any way that you want it to go with ZERO bounceback. In addition to moving effectively right and left and up and down, the head of the light twists equally well and stays put.

The light itself is pleasing with 3 LEDs, and covers the page nicely from mass market paperbacks on up to hard cover releases (I have used it now for both, as well as a trade paperback.)  It is light enough to not bend or damage the book or be falling backwards.  The non-skid pad inside the back of the clip keeps it from sliding around the book or falling sideways as so many of my lights with slip on clips do.

The only caveat that I would mention is that you have to want a light that takes standard batteries.  This takes 3 AAAs, which I love as I can use rechargable batteries.  They are easy to change and don't add to much weight, but does make for a larger housing than some people want in their booklights.  I'll take that any day to having to dig up expensive and sometimes hard to find ""watch"" batteries.  I have yet to need to change the batteries after three large books worth of reading thanks to the LEDs.

The light has a full and dim setting which my husband appreciates when I am reading in bed.

If you are looking for a new booklight (and want one with standard batteries) you have found it.  I can't recommend this highly enough.",310,15,0,13

Kindle_Store_5,5.0,1,"I wasn't sure if I was going to like this or not - a mix of Tudor history and fantasy/magic? I was pleased to find that it was excellent, and I read it in two days!

The author clearly knows her subjects very well indeed, which always makes such a difference. The history itself is detailed and accurate, and I very much liked the accounts of the day to day domestic life of the period. I'm fascinated by the thought of possible alternative lives, and the idea of what might have happened had Henry VIII believed his wife Anne Boleyn over the accusations of her enemies is an intriguing one. Of course all events have a butterfly's wing effect, and Ms Taylor imagined the fates of other members of the Tudor court very cleverly. The politics of the day are very well described, too; how quickly, in those dangerous and turbulent times, one could fall from favour...

I am not usually one for magic/fantasy novels, but this element of the story was most convincing; it made me think of a more grown up and serious Hogwarts! I wonder how much of it was just the author's imagination and how much was taken from the beliefs and practices of the time; I imagine it's a combination of the two. I particularly liked the parts about numerology and the breaking of codes; oddly enough I was only watching a TV programme last night about the use of codes in secret communications during Elizabethan times, and Ms Taylor has all this spot on. To sum up, the fusing of history with fantasy is very successful, and I shall definitely be reading the next book in the series before too long. I think it would appeal to anyone interested in the Tudor period, and to those who enjoy reading believable fantasy.",307,12,2,14

Some may prefer the 2L, but I love the size and weight for a setup not requiring an extended burn time for (ie. home defense).  It mounts very well with the Magpul MLOK Offset mount.  I did make one small modification that would be nice to see from the factory as an option.  I (very carefully) drilled out the existing screw holes to accommodate the mlok size screws so that I could directly attach it extremely securely to my MI handguard.

But it does what it says! The finish is awesome and durable, the handle is great. If you are tearing through Amazon looking for a great insulated bottle, this is it. Trust me, I did the research. This is up there with Yetis, S'well, etc. It's aweosme but way more functional.",176,16,2,12

Electronics_5,4.0,1,"I like this because it is small and ergonomically well designed.  I am keeping it.  However, there are many tradeoffs and issues that anyone should note:

1.  The movie function is better in quality than stills for almost all conditions.

2.  The movie function sound picks up faint noise from absolutely everything the camera does, from zoom to auto adjust the focus.  This can only be heard under quiet conditions, but it is there, and in fact mentioned in the manual.

3.  The low light still is very poor, except if it is pitch dark and you set it for that condition.  I find taking pictures indoors without the flash superior than with it on.

4.  The camera is very sensitive to shakes during still...and the image stabalizer only works for movies.  This really needs a good image stabalizer for stills, since slight motion ruins the image, particularly in zoom.

5.  It is true you can take a still while recording a movie.  However, what is not mentioned, is that the movie is interrupted during the capture and that sounds of shutter clicking at quite high level invade the audio

I love the camera for convenience and remarkable capability.

From other reviews, the new HD version solves none of the issues I mention.

Well-taken stills with the Epson Picturemate printer are excellent.

My daughter just turned 7 so this game was a little too easy for her, but she still loves it.  This InnoTab game allows children to choose easy or difficult levels. Sofia talks to her friends to get clues to find the door for her class, as they have been changed. Behind the doors are the classes where games are played such as matching game, art class and find the missing pieces. The game has seven learning games and two creative activities to teach counting, colors, patterns, problem solving and more!

Movies_and_TV_5,5.0,1,"Originally released in 1934 as ""Babes in Toyland,"" this film is far and away the best of the Laurel & Hardy operettas.  The evil Barnaby (Henry Brandon), wants to force the lovely Bo-Beep (Charlotte Henry) to marry him.  Towards this end Barnaby banishes Bo-Beep's beloved Tom-Tom (Felix Knight) and attempts to take over Toyland with his demon army.  Fortunately, Stannie Dum and Ollie Dee, the assistants of the Toymaker (William Burgess), save the day with the help of the marvelous giant-sized Wooden Soldiers.  Based on the operetta by Victor Herbert (several songs are omitted), this film was directed by Gus Meins and Charles Rogers, and is much superior to the Disney version that ended up replacing it on television.  You will find less slapstick than usual in a Laurel & Hardy film, but the boys are better integrated into this musical than any of there others and Brandon's Barnaby is deliciously wicked.

These jobs included drilling in stainless steel and even as the bit broke through the work the DeWalt did not stall and the chuck held the number 3 bit flawlessly.
I only had one surprise with the DeWalt and that was that the clutch functions only on the high speed setting.

Movies_and_TV_5,5.0,1,"The even spread of 5 star through 1 star comments here reflect the subjective experience of the viewers more than any film I have seen recently. Now in his eighties, Eastwood directs a film whose theme lies close to heart of all people who have matured as they have aged. It is a reflection on the possibilities of the afterlife that we all think about as we age. Eastwood offers no answers but instead gives us 3 parallel stories of people who have experienced death or near death; a woman drowned in a tsunami, a psychic who sees his ability as an affliction, and a young boy who loses his twin to death. Each protagonist searches for answers, as we all do. Viewers may not be satisfied by that lack of concrete solutions but a film about death and acceptance can have no other ending. Some viewers may be fooled by the opening tsunami sequence into thinking that this is an action film. The absorbingly realistic set of CGI sequences that open the film makes other CGI laden films look artificial and lame. But it  is not an action film though studio marketing may have given people that idea. In lesser hands a film like this would be filled by after death pseudo babble that has been all to common in American cinema over the decades. Entertaining but trivial films such as 'Ghost' are pedestrian but pleasant to watch. TV shows like 'Medium' were light silly but enjoyable time wasters. Eastwood does nothing like that here. Instead this is a film for people who think, those who are at the end of life, and those who have had life threatening experiences. Highly recommended.",283,15,0,5

The Stomp Launcher is a little sturdier, but the step pad is smaller and the cord is shorter so with not as much air the rockets don't go as far but he loves that the rockets look more like a space shuttle style rocket.

Casters can be removed and stored within the bottom of the unit, securely for storage.
Cord has storage compartment with a closing door, which latches securely.
Four Heat settings.
Silent.
Highly Effective.

Cons:
Documentation is a little dated, refers to the switches on the unit being a rotary type dial control.

While the product description does mention a circulation fan, I don't see one - and frankly I'm glad it doesn't seem to have one.  It's silent, totally silent.  Setting switch 3 (Bottom Element) to ON (375 Watts), more than ample to heat my entire upstairs.  A pleasant slow event heat.

The product isn't UL listed, but it is ETL listed.  There is an overheat circuit interrupt with a button on the back of the unit, and sensitive tip over cut-off switch.  Very pleased with the safety of the unit overall.

The unit functions in two ways, first is the reflective heat you can see and feel when the unit is ON; it feels like warm sunshine.  Second, it functions as a convection heater; air passes through from the cold floor up through the unit and is released via a grill on the top of the unit.

Switch Layout:
Switch 3 - Bottom Element
Switch 2 - Top Two Elements
Switch 1 - Second From Bottom Element

Dial:
No temperature markings, does have a very wide travel path; so accurate temperature control is very easy.

Most heaters of this type are two settings only, ~1000 Watt, and ~1500 Watt.  This results in good warmth, but results in the area in front of the unit being warmer than the rest of the room.

When I purchased, there were only two reviews on this unit.  One review was particularly harsh and gave a One-Star due to the misprint about the fan. I decided to take the plunge and buy the heater anyway; very glad for my decision to buy.",318,28,0,6

In 175 pages of rather well written prose about a rich woman I could never stand and from the viewpoint of her passive-aggressive attorney husband living in a snobby neighborhood of the famous Gold Coast of west Long Island, New York, let me tell you what happened.

Other than the narrator getting his ashes hauled a few times by his kinky, often emotionally unavailable wife, expressing a massively slow burn about his Mafia Don new neighbor, and the worlds shortest mid-life crisis, nothing has happened. Let me repeat that. NOTHING. He has described rich home after rich home, and some pleasant pieces of New York society historydropping a few names we know like Rockefeller, Rothchilds and so onother than that, zilch. Bupkis.

I do like the quietly snarky sense of humor he shows us but seldom shows the other characters, but other than that? This book is a waste of my time and yours.

We are slowly integrating our children into school after years of homeschooling and now have to deal with sending a lunch - mostly sandwiches or other cold items. I needed something to keep the food cold for just a few hours, but not too bulky either.

These thin, bread size ice packs are perfect. They are less than  thick and like I said the size of a slice of bread. They fit perfectly into a Bento lunchbox we own and even a small metal box. (I have included pictures so you can see.) Plus, being so thin a sandwich or other food items still fit in the container. So many of my other ice packs are bulky and take up so much room I have no space left for the food.

The ice pack stays cool long enough to keep the food chilled until lunch time. And if I feel the food needs some extra coldness, due to the thin nature of the ice pack, I can place one on the bottom and one on the top.

They are easy to clean. I just rinse them off, or if they get quite a bit of food on them, I just wash in some sudsy water. They re-chill quickly in the freezer and are always ready for the next day. Plus, again due to the thinness, they do not take up a huge amount of space in my already cramped freezer. And, the best part, being a hard plastic they do not get holes and leak all over. I have had way too many ice packs leak.

One thing I'd like to add is the ice pack has a ""food"" side and a ""lid"" side. I don't see a difference?

Pros:
Thin (less than  thick)
Size of a slice of bread
Keep food cold for at least 4 hrs.
Hard plastic and do not leak
Easy cleaning
Do not take up a lot of space in the freezer

Cons:
Do not stay cold all day

I was given the ice packs for free in exchange for my opinion and review.",357,29,0,19
Books_5,4.0,1,"Life has not been kind to John Moon.  Depressed because his wife left him, he spends his lonely days planning a reunion that will never happen.  Living alone in a cramped, dirty trailer, he leads a hand to mouth existence.  Chronically unemployed, he has taken to poaching to put food on his table.

One morning, Moon hunts and wounds a deer.  Tracking the animal to a nearby rock quarry, he senses movement behind him.  Reacting instinctively,  he whirls and fires a single shot into the surrounding wood, and sees something brown crash to the ground.  Assuming he has downed the deer, he begins to walk towards the trees.  It is only after he is charged by the wounded deer that he realizes he must have shot something else.

When Moon investigates, he discovers the body of a young woman.  Struggling to stay calm, Moon conducts a search of  the area, and discovers the girl's belongings, along with a package containing some $80,000 in cash.  Moon, overwhelmed by events, decides to hide the body and take the cash.  Shortly thereafter, he finds himself at the center of a bizarre series of events, as the money's owners eventually trace it back to him.  Moon, unable to contact the authorities, becomes involved in a life or death game of cat and mouse with ruthless criminals who have only one goal--to get their money back at all costs.

A Single Shot is a convincing portrait of a simple man caught up in circumstances beyond his control.  Moon's anxiety and despair is palpable, and the sense of menace Jones creates is almost overwhelming at times.  Grim and macabre, this gripping saga of small town mayhem and madness will shock and disturb you.  Reminiscent of the work of Jack Ketchum and James Dickey,  A Single Shot really hits the mark.",304,18,0,0

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,1,"Great for line-tending when watching ice divers!!! The divers in the water are always clipped to a thick line but a person needs to be holding that line to send 'pull signals', to pull them back, etc. The problem is that ice diving occurs in water just above freezing, definite winter conditions above the water. Wearing normal winter ski gloves doesn't work because they soak through with water as you grab the line; these don't get wet on the inside unless you let water run into them from the opening (hard to do, these have really long wrist areas and you don't tend to raise your hands up high too much while line-tending). Hands stayed warm from the fleecy material inside (I tested them at approximately -10F).

I admit I was disappointed in these gloves out of the box because the seams had rough edges where they were fused together - but as long as you're not rubbing delicate skin (or something) with the outside of the glove, it isn't a problem at all.

I also tried these for summer kayaking in Alaska because my hands always got cold from the cool water. Wearing these gloves was too hot. Sweat made them soaking wet inside since they don't breathe.

I laughed my head off that anyone would try these for Alaskan winters (aurora viewing/vacation). These won't help you at -40 temperatures. Buy real ski gloves (hopefully with a palm big enough to allow you to ball your hands up into a fist for finger warmth if needed) or mittens (the thick kind with waterproof covers).",265,12,3,7

Electronics_5,4.0,1,"I've had my XTi for just over a month now (bought from Amazon) and it's really improved my photography.  Others have even commented that I've ""shifted to a new gear"".  Features are a nice improvement from the DSLR-wannabe I had before (Panasonic FZ30) but it's the image quality that's really the big step up.  Get the best-quality lenses for this (*not* the kit lens) and you'll be very happy.

Pros:

* Image Quality
* Ergonomics (most common settings are easy to change, good displays)
* Battery life (200 shots with 50% flash and battery still said 100%)
* The user manual is decent, though not stellar.
* Long exposure noise reduction feature is very good.
* Good set of customization options (though the manual doesn't explain them enough).

Cons:

* Canon's organizer/editor software, Digital Photo Professional, always crashes on my Windows PC and technical support was no help.
* Hand grip is too small (height and volume) for my large hand.  Make sure you handle one first.  I had to train myself to squish all three fingers into the space provided so my pinky didn't hang off the bottom.  This is a real step backwards from the original Digital Rebel.
* Some settings that I use a lot are hidden too far in the menus.
* Sensor dust cleaner won't get everything.  I had to manually blow dust off the sensor (with a blower, *NOT* my breath!) about 1 week after I got this, though no sensor dust since.

Conclusion:
I'm *very* glad I bought this camera and look forward to many years using it.

Electronics_5,5.0,1,"I have been using the Centon Electronics Flash Memory Card (S1-SDXU1-64G) for the past few weeks in my Samsung digital camera and also my Sony digital videocamera. This high-performance SD card, with an impressive 64GB of storage, doubled the capacity of my previous SD cards. While not an issue with my digital camera, the card has already eliminated the nuisance of running out of storage on my video camera (with 16GB of internal storage) while traveling/sightseeing.

The Centon SD card eliminates the need to connect either camera directly to my computer in order to download the photos/videos. My iMac has an SD slot but I use a USB SD card reader for my MacBook Pro while traveling. And it is fast, and that means I can take more photos faster... and I also don't have to wait for my video camera in-between shots. In addition to cameras, this Centon SD card is also compatible with some models of Android smartphones.

The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that the plastic parts are very heavy, and the cover is very large. If you are wearing a swim cap, you will need to hold it upside down. The material is not strong enough to hold your head and face in place, and it is a little uncomfortable to use for my purposes. The handle seems to be made of plastic, and the feel of the strap is not very comfortable. It is not hard to pull, but if you are wearing a small swim cap, it may be a little more difficult to pull it up.

The character turns around played by Jan Michael Vincent says, ""you already do."" It's hilarious. It's delivered with the straightest of faces that Jan Michael can deliver and it's got an endearing Keanu Reeves quality to it.

The movie's basic premise is that Jan Michael lives in a blue collar town that's completely out of control. He goes and get's a guy to come be a deputy and clean up the town. Only,, the guy turns out to be just as evil as the guys he's cleaning up. Hence, they might need a vigilante force.

Everyone in the movie is good. Kristofferson is great as always. He's a likable villain who charms his way into his position to take over the town. Jan Michael is the sort of guy you're surprised didn't play Captain America in the 70s. He looks like a piece of by-gone Americana. The actresses are randomly Bernadette Peters and Victoria Principal. Both of them are young or youngish and look like the sort of girls you could find ruling as queen bees on opposite sides of the track in a small town. The rest of the cast is great characters actors from TV and movies from back then.

It's not a genius movie. It's a trashy action movie that has some bonkers moments like a marching band member with a rocket launcher. It's also only 89 minutes. It's the best way for a movie like this to go. In and out fast. It never outstays it's welcome. It shows up with a good smile and sends you on your way.",295,23,0,0

Both were priced well and both had the Edison rebate which had swallowing the mid $200 device much easier. I ended up going with the Ecobee for a few reasons.

1. There was a return unit being sold thru Amazon Warehouse deals. I guess this was a return for some reason.
2. This unit included a wireless unit that I could put in my master bedroom to monitor the temp in there.

Actually I have come to own a digital thermostat because when we went on vacation over the summer weekend, I forgot to turn off the AC and it ran on the hottest days. That was a lesson learned. I won't be having that issue anymore.

There was some work to be had during the installation as I had to access my furnace in my attic to tap into the main wire set. The Ecobee does not run on batteries so it needed to have an extra module hard wired in. It was difficult but just difficult getting around my attic.

Thermostat works like a charm. No issues and I got lucky with the used item. All is well.",230,24,0,16

Using Death as the narrator adds another dimension to the novel. Nothing is new to Death, and yet he is moved and intrigued by this story and shares it with us, showing us the complexity of humanity. The Book Thief is the best contemporary young adult book I've read. I know some people feel it was wrongly marketed that way, but I think it fits the audience well, while not writing down to them. The voice and style are distinct enough to make it feel special, while the subject matter and characters are real enough to tell a great deal of truth about the human condition.

I did think it would have more gravy in it given its sold as a gravy cravers dog food but that's alright, I can add just a little warm water for gravy. Its mostly a smooth pate of food, except the Filet Mignon, that has slight chunks along with the pate. This doesn't smell nasty, it actually does smell quite good. Similar to canned beef stew. All and all, this is a very good canned food for the price. Its also nice that I can have it shipped to my home with prime.

Last she remembers, she was eagerly anticipating the arrival of her first child, now she has three kids and an unhappy marriage. She is also experiencing a strained relationship with her sister and her mother has made startling life changes, as well. The entire book is a contrast and comparison between her ""younger"" mind and her ""older mind. "" Her younger self was filled with hope and excitement and joy, while her older self is stressed, unfulfilled and fighting feelings of resentment and overall unhappiness. Moriarty uses the character of Alice to explore some very philosophical questions. Every moment of our lives is made up of choices and for Alice, she has just fast-forwarded through 10 years worth of choices. Moriarty takes a fascinating concept and infuses it with beautiful writing, relatable characters and a powerful story line. WHAT ALICE FORGOT also examines the amount of change that can happen to a person in a 10 year period and how these changes make us more interesting and complex individuals but can also create issues that we wish we could undo. Alice wakes up to find that she has become a person she no longer recognizes, it is now up to her to find out where things went wrong and to see if she can change what she seems to have forgotten.

I was very impressed with the writing style and the characters.  I was also very impressed with the story line.  I love a good mystery with a good twist.  I have never read a book that has such a good ending.  I felt like I was right there with the main character.  I'm not going to say too much because the ending is too abrupt, but I feel like the author did a great job of giving the book a great ending.  I read the first two books in the series and I loved this one.  The author does an excellent job with the story and the characters.  I am looking forward to the next book in the series.  Thank you for the opportunity to read this book.  I was given a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.I received an ARC copy of this book",178,14,0,15
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,1,"Whoever designed this simple, yet CRITICAL piece of gear should be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.  I love my cattle dog mix, even though she is an on-the-go-pooper.  One every walk.  Usually within the first 5 minutes of a 30-45 minute walk.  Being a responsible dog owner, I carry the bags and then had to use that knot/leash hold maneuver to carry her deposit to a proper repository.  Two months ago, we adopted a second cattle dog mix and now I have a leash in each hand while I walk the poopingest dogs in the world.  Bag juggle??? Not so much.

So I searched for a solution and I found this simple, yet AMAZING solution.  It's durable and can't imagine it will take years for the rubber to stretch out and give way.  I have one for each leash making it much safer to walk them because I've got positive control of the leashes.  I sent one to my aunt and one to my mom for their dogs.  I suggested my dog walker to charge each client a one time fee to get one for each of her walking clients.

The dog accessory industry is so vast, yet this is one of the must underrated necessities.  I have NEVER found anything like this in stores.  I'm glad someone thought of making them.  Bravo Alcott.... Bravo.",225,18,0,17

Kindle_Store_5,4.0,1,"Cass is a single mother as a result of a one night stand.

Logan was the one night stand.

Now a twist if fate has them meet up again in somewhat secret circumstances.
Cass is Logans boss but she has no clue about his secret that could change everything.

This book started off at a steady pace, then it slowed down in the middle and hit it's stride again in the last 3rd.

Cass and Logan are both head strong and career driven. They have different experiences in life and this shows in each interaction they have. Because of the complexity of their situation there are a lot of undercurrents in their conversations, but only one of them is aware of it.

The author has done a good job showing the different sides to her characters personalities. The chemistry between Logan and Cass never diminishes and the love they have for their daughter despite the intricacies they face shines through and comes above everything else.

I enjoyed this story. The characters and the storyline is consistent and interesting and I liked the dynamics of the other relationships each Cass and Logan have with others such as Logan's grandmother and Cass's friend Patricia. Those relationships added another layer and also a bit of lightness to the storyline.

This is a great holiday read and worth one clicking if you like a good romance!

Electronics_5,5.0,1,"I upgraded my Denon 2809CI for the SR5008.  The SR5008 chassis size is not as deep so it doesn't take up as much space on the shelf.  Since this is the bedroom I have a simple two channel setup with Axiom M60 floorstanding speakers and HSU Research STF-2 subwoofer.  I like the attention to detail such as the little vibration absorbing material (looks like Sorbothane soft rubber) on the feet to protect the electronics from the nearby subwoofer.

Previously I could not use Audessy with the older Denon because of the simple speaker setup.  Now with the Marantz SR5008 I was able to fly through the Audessy measurements and the sound difference is NIGHT AND DAY!  With the Audessy calibrated stereo setup, the sound is 3-dimensional and super clear.  I'm also selected the bi-amp option for the front speakers just to try it out (not sure if that makes a difference, but it's cool to have the option to put those extra Watts to use).  I would describe it as having a ""warm"" sound which I love.  I used to be a musician and I can distinguish subtle differences in sound quality.

The on-screen menu is very simple and easy to navigate.  When streaming Pandora Internet Radio, the song name and play timer is displayed on the Marantz portal window so I can still see the song name while the TV is turned off.  Some review on the web mentioned the lack of WiFi, but I think it would be silly to integrate WiFi into a high end AVR receiver because WiFi technology is changing so fast (802.11G, N, AC, etc. will be obsolete well before the receiver is outdated).  Simply get a tiny WiFi adapter such as the Netgear WNCE2001 or WNCE3001, plug it in and you're set for wireless as well.",303,16,1,13

The Nameless Dwarf Omnibus contains the first three stories following the dwarf known only as Nameless.  If you have read some of Derek's other work than you may be familiar with him as he has been a companion of Shadrak the Unseen and Deacon Shader.

The book starts out with Nameless being a very mysterious figure who has hired a boy from the Night Hawks (a criminal group) to help him find information on where his people have fled to.  Nils, his companion, is the son of the leader of the guild out to prove his worth as a man.  During the journey they meet up with Silas, a magic user, who is studying the stolen grimoire of the Liche Lord Otto Blightey.  At the end of Ant-Man Ilesa joins up with the group as well.  She is a woman who seems to have some level of skill with shapeshifting/illusion magic.  As the stories progress the characters true natures are revealed as their stories are unraveled.  Derek has done a wonderful job keeping the main story on point while gradually revealing the backgrounds of all the people involved.

The book starts out with a lot of information and someone who is unfamiliar with the world Derek has created might struggle a bit at first.  As the book progresses everything comes together beautifully and by the end I didn't want to stop reading for any reason.  I will also be checking out the next story in the series, The Ebon Staff as soon as possible to see what will happen.

Kindle_Store_5,5.0,1,"Liz and Landon have been together the better part of 4 years. She refers to them as peas and carrots. They go well together, but there is not a lot of excitement. They are busy, sometimes ships in the night.

Then suddenly, they are laying it on the line and he proposes. The excitement is back and it it makes Liz want to find a way to keep it! She wants to be strawberries and whip cream instead of peas and carrots. And they have it, at least for now.

The she says to him how about we wait until our wedding night? The bet is on. Whoever does not give in gets the honeymoon they have dreamed of. Liz is pleased even though she wants to jump Landon. Then they are busy trying to pay for the wedding, survive the in-laws, and not get evicted.

Such an amazingly great story! I have not laughed, and cried so much for a book in a while. I was truly impressed and that is not so simple to do. I found the characters sincere and their quest was for the same thing we all want - to be happy we have found the right someone and have the happy after the buildup.

I have to say I cannot wait for the next installment in the All About Love series. The author has really brought her A game to these books, so be prepared to enjoy with plenty of chocolate and tissues.

Movies_and_TV_5,5.0,1,"After the solid third season, Frasier came back with what could arguably be its best season. There were new storylines: Martin meeting a new lady, Sherry (played by Marsha Mason), who doesn't exactly hit it off with the rest of the gang--as well as continuations of old ones: Niles trying to reconcile with Maris. The biggest story of this season, though, was off-camera: star Kelsey Grammer went into rehab, which necessitated that the others in the cast pick up the slack. They proved up to the task, of course, and upon Grammer's return the show became better than ever. In this season, we were visited by familiar faces like Lilith and Frederick for a memorable Thanksgiving episode, as well as Agent Bebe, as well as surprise appearances (James Earl Jones). In addition, this season contained some of the truly greatest episodes of this show: the opener, The Two Mrs. Cranes, had the show's farcical sense of its humor at its most potent, Ham Radio featured delightfully unhinged performances by the supporting cast, and Are You Being Served? features one of the show's funniest moments. This is where the show hit its peak: the synthesis of great acting, writing, and ensemble acting that made this show memorable. If you love Frasier, these episodes are probably many of the reasons why. If you only buy one set of Frasier DVDs, this should probably be it.",233,11,0,1
Toys_and_Games_5,4.0,1,"OK, so Fisher-Price isn't the same as it was when YOU were a kid.
Newsflash!
Neither are today's kids.

I understand that people are sceptical of tie-ins with movies, but that at least is familiar to all of us. That has always been around.

I think the biggest complaint for the Imaginext line for me, which I DO have, myself, is the quality for the price. The plastic is not as high quality as it should be.

However, I disagree on a different point with a number of the other reviewers here.

I am talking about the ""boredom factor"" mentioned. It seems to plague many of the parents or reviewers.

I have one question. I do not mean to offend people, just to make them think.

Take a 6 year old, for example (not a 3 year old--this toy is recommended for 36 months to age 8!!!-- unless the 36 month old in question is a card carrying member of MENSA), and try opening this WITH him or her ... and playing with it TOGETHER!

It is kind of similar to learning to read a book, when you learn to play. You need guidance. Ages 4-6 (which I figure are the most appropriate for the Imaginext DC Super Friends Superman Playset) are still encompassing fairly young children.
Reading to a child in that age range makes books something which will then be loved far more than if a child just looks at books by him or her self.

It is the same thing with a toy like this. Don't expect a toy to be a babysitter.

Play with your child when you offer your child the toy.

There is lots to do with it! We like it very much.
I hope you understand that I am not dissing everyone who called it boring.
I am just providing a different perspective. Thanks for reading!
Mom of five sons here! :)

Fast forward two years. Cass is an independent successful woman, striving to be taken seriously in a field dominated by men. Life has not turned out exactly as she'd expected, but she is smart and secure enough in herself and her goals to roll with the changes that life has thrown her way. Finding herself a single mom, she has more than risen to the occasion, and is raising Olivia with the love that she never experienced in her own childhood.

While Logan has spent the last two years dedicated to his job, he hasn't ever forgotten that night with Cass. When the two meet again, it's like the sexual tension has been simmering under the surface, and like they haven't been apart at all. Finding out that Cass (or Miss Mary, as he calls her; seriously sexy!) and he have a daughter rocks his world. Even though he is angry that she's kept Olivia from him (or so he thinks), he can't fight the attraction for Cass that's still as strong as ever.

I thoroughly enjoyed this book. There is humor, intrigue (it's a spy story, after all!), passion, and so much love.

Four bad guys are on their way to East Africa to secure a deal with uranium mines. Their agent is Billy (Humphrey Bogart) a man who is a ""typical rare spirit."" His wife is Maria (Gina Lollobrigida). They meet a British couple who are also on their way to Africa. Gina falls for the husband Harry (Edward Underdown) while Harry's wife Gwendolen (Jennifer Jones) falls for Billy. They are stranded in Italy as the boat is in need of repairs and the captain is always full of spirits.

Jennifer Jones steals this film as a fast thinker with an over active imagination who is prone to lying in every situation. The dialouge, in part written by Truman Capote, reflects national stereotypes that translate into today's world as well as clever oxymorons, mispronounced words and misused phrases. It is film in which you want to pay close attention to the words. The bad guys are quite the lot. Peter Lorre plays Julius O'Hara, claiming ""There are a lot of German O'Hara's from Chile."" Maj.

Movies_and_TV_5,5.0,1,"Ok, this is one of those bias reviews that people write about.  For example, a huge Aerosmith fan may write about how great they were and are, going on how Aerosmith is the greatest band in history, blah blah blah.  But when one is talking of professional wrestling, the first name that pops in peoples minds is Hulk Hogan.  With that, he is the greatest, biggest, and most popular name in the history of sports entertainment.  I could care less about his technical wrestling skills, because we all know that pro wrestling is fake and how good of a technical wrestler someone is has no effect on the outcome of the match.  So, charisma, charisma, charisma is where it's at and no one had more or better charisma than Hulk Hogan.  I have watched this on more than one occasion.  It is money well spent.  I would have easily paid 100 bucks for this, but thankfully it was no where near that expensive.

The only downside of this DVD is the lack of biographical material.  But it makes up for that with tons of matches.  The overall match selection was really good.  It covers matches from way back during his first run in the WWE in the late 70's to his championship run in the 80's and early 90's to the WCW/NWO days all the way up until his last match with Randy Orton last year.  The DVD was only missing one or two matches that I personally liked a lot.  Those were the matches with Earthquake from Summerslam 90 and the match against Sid Justice from Wrestlemania VIII.  These two matches really showed the ovation Hogan commonly recieved, but amplified many times due to the circumstances.

My personal favorite was the match with The Iron Sheik from January 1984, where it really all began.",305,17,0,6

Movies_and_TV_5,4.0,1,"This 2000 Israeli film is as fresh as today's headlines.  Set in a settlement in Israel it's about a radical rabbi and his ardent followers, two best friends who compete for the rabbi's daughter, and the ongoing conflicts of orthodoxy and secularism in Israel.

The film is as bleak as the landscape around the settlement.  And the rabbi's radicalism is the one thing that keeps the young men bound together.  One of them is in the army and creates a religious unit much to the concern of his superiors who distrust the radicalism, even though the soldiers perform well.  Another young man is the scholar and the rabbi wants him to marry his daughter.  Alas, though, she prefers the soldier.  Trouble follows.  She leaves the settlement and goes to the city where she finds an apartment with some other religious young women.

Her rejection of her religious suitor, however, pushes him to plan to commit a radical act and he involves the soldier as well as another innocent friend in the plan.  How this all plays out is scary, as we are all aware of the potential violence of terrorist attacks.  This film brings this all out as well as some complex psychological factors.

The problem was that the story moved a little two slowly for my taste.  Also, as it was a foreign film, I know that it lost a lot in translation.  It seemed as if some parts were missing and the narrative seemed to jump round awkwardly.  So, in spite of its message and the tension raised regarding what would happen next, I found myself looking at the clock and feeling bored.

That is, if you are a grown up reader, probably this novel will not satisfy you. It is too short, and the characters are very sketchy. They lack depth and so does the story. However, if I were to recommend this book to a young reader, I certainly would.

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,4.0,1,"Its a good stand for infrequent repair work. Arrived early and assembled in about 10 minutes. Looks sharp and professional and the color is a nice touch and it feels very sturdy.

However I did experience some things that I did take a star from.
1. The bolt that supports the clamp came slightly bent. Trying to figure out if its worth taking and putting it in my vise to bend back or call park tool and do the return dance. Its not a severe bend, but when under load it is clearly visible but not sagging too much

2. The clamp rotating mechanism on mine tends to stick. I am chalking this up to needing some lubrication in the top to allow some more movement.

3. The legs do not fold up into a contraption that allows them to stay. The kind of flop around. A nite-ize might solve this and clean this up, but how hard would it be to include a plastic piece to put on the stand to keep the legs together?

I honestly expected a bit more from Park Tool. If the bolt is bent from a default then I get that, but I bought this stand and spent more money since I didn't want what looked like Chinese knockoffs and the quality that I know and come to love with Park Tool. This is a great stand to use when I am cleaning my bike after a ride or doing some adjusting, but I would be weary to doing some hard core wrenching on this due to the clamp. I am just getting into MTBing so this will suit me fine, but serious and seasoned riders might want to look to a PCS-10 or another step up stand.

As a project, I laminated all her photos and then we used these magnets to stick them to the fridge.  These were strong enough to hold the one sheet of laminated photo per magnet, which worked out fine for what we needed.  However, if you were to add say two or three sheets of laminated photo, the magnets don't seem to be as strong.  These are not the strongest magnet, but they are not the weakest either.  They can hold up about three to four sheets of unlaminated photos, just to give you and understanding of their strength.

Books_5,4.0,1,"Bigger Thomas and his story of murder and societal havoc is a pretty damn good tale. Wright's penchant for defining Thomas by the horrid lifestyles of the African-Americans in this time is both thought provoking and a little misguided. B By and large blaming society for things like the graphic rape and murder of Bessie gets a little old by the end. It's simply seems like a ploy for an agenda, and boy is there an agenda and cause in this novel. Anyway, plenty of great criticism has sprung up around this book, and I recommend James Baldwin's piece after you are done with the novel.

Yes, it is true the society he lives in does create him and manifest his destination in some way, but the horrific things he does, and for having very few redeeming qualities, Bigger is definitely going to create division in people. And that is what I really don't like about him. His lawyer making the super tepid statement about his entire travails like it is almost okay that he exists because ""society did it"" seems ridiculous in context when you realize that people still have to bear their burdens, no matter what race or color, and Bigger chose to give in to his demons. No amount of patronizing or persuasion is ever going to make me totally see Wright's communist point of view and agenda in this novel, but it is well-written and worth the time to read it.

Movies_and_TV_5,5.0,1,"""The Terminator"" directed by the brilliant James Cameron, is the most thought-provoking motion picture of the 1980's. What if computers controlled the world? Well, in 1984, a man named Kyle Reese and a terminator were sent to kill the mother of the rebel leader of the future. Sarah Connor supposedly gives birth to the leader of human resistance to the machines and his name is John Connor. The man was sent to protect her and the machine was sent to  change the course of time. Arnold Schwarzenegger is the ultimate mechanism that has no feeling and no heart! How frosty! It's the fight of a lifetime between the man and the machine, but unfortunately, the man loses. After many deaths fulfilled by the terminator, Sarah Connor crushes it. I was so perturbed with the extermination of Arnold, I turned it off right then. Arnold should never die in a movie.

Kindle_Store_5,4.0,1,"Crave is a highly emotional story about Kiera, Kevin and Jimmy. It has that love triangle feel to it, mainly because Kiera spends a lot of time evaluating her relationships. Kiera is an emotionally stunted woman. She doesn't seem to know her worth & impresses her skewed view on those closest to her. Her best friend Kevin is admittedly in love with her, but demonstrates a lot of hate for her as well. It's as if his devotion has been one sided for so long it's become bitter. At the beginning, Kiera's relationship with Jimmy, a man she feels she belongs with, ends & her self-imposed spiral into depression takes a drastic turn when she has sex with Kevin. It's not hearts & flowers, you're the love of my life kind of sex. More like angry, you can get the hell out of my life kind of sex. This only proves to confuse an already confused Keira. This story centers around a woman trying to grab her bearings. Everything that she thought was real is being stripped away. She no longer has Jimmy, her man, or Kevin, her sounding board; her cupcake business is in ruins. Her life at the end of her twenties isn't turning out so great. Without giving too much away, this story has me on the fence. I liked it, and yet I found myself not really enjoying the heroine. Let me clarify; part of me liked her and understood her, and yet part of me wanted to slap her and tell her to man the heck up. She needed to open her eyes.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,1,"I bought this vacuum cleaner 3 months ago and absolutely love it!! I am 69 and have a lot of difficulty maneuvering my heavy Kenmore canister vacuum anymore. I have had other stick or similar size vacuums before, but always ended up being disappointed in their performance. Not this one!! This machine is very light but does a fantastic job at picking up dirt in spite of its size. I like the fact that the ""footprint"" is not wide like the usual uprights as it can do a better job of going in tight spaces. I like the transparent cup which is easy to empty without getting dirty hands in the process, the fact that you do not need to buy paper filters, the easy to disassemble construction if you want to give it a thorough cleaning. I also like the sponge type of filter that you just need to rinse thoroughly when too dirty. I actually bought additional filters in case I needed to do soso I would not have to wait for it to dry. The first time I used it I was shocked at the amount of dirt and cat hair I amassed! This was the only time so far I have had to disassemble and clean the inner tube. You know you have to do so because you notice that the suction then is poor.
As you can see, I am tickled pink! This is the perfect vacuum for seniors or small apartments.
The only thing which would make it better: a handle on the front at the cup height to help hold it when vacuuming say stairs or sofa.  A hose attachment would be nice too but can be easily be done without the old fashion way (broom/ brush and rag) For the price and the performance and ease I do not believe it would be fair to remove a star.

Books_5,1.0,1,"Unfortunately, I just finished ""Wild Fire"" and am sad to report that DeMille's quality is continuing the slide downward that began with ""Night Fall"".

Through his magnus opus ""Up Country"", Nelson DeMille was my favorite fiction author. But in his last two books, he's decided to weave his stories in and out of catastrophic real-life events. I frankly don't care about John Corey's posiiton on George W. Bush or when to invade Iraq...I appreciate an author who creates an entirely new universe and populates it USING HIS IMAGINATION. Just like DeMille used to do in his other novels. Shoehorning real life events into his recent books has taken priority over a strong narrative and the storytelling suffers under this neglect. It's a blatant attempt at broadening his appeal that does so at the detriment of his longtime fans' intellect.

It's also worth noting he's writing books now that run about half the number of pages his past work offered. It's been pointed out he has contractual deadlines to deliver a book every November...I personally don't feel like this is a valid justification for the startling decrease in pages and by extension, story.

Electronics_5,4.0,1,"It does what it says - it provides a stable mount for up to two 2.5"" drives in a regular internal hard drive slot. Here are the problems:

It's not compatible with the newer ""toolless"" cases that use posts rather than screws to secure the hard drive. The posts will not fit through the holes. Luckily, thermaltake does provide all the screws you need - just pop the posts out of your hard drive tray or mounting bracket and replace with the larger of the two sizes of screw they provide.

It is also difficult to access the screw hols for the lower of the two drives in this mount. If you need to mount two drives, do the lower one first, and find a small screwdriver.

Finally, the connectors for the hard drive will be recessed about one inch into the bay compared to the rest of the drives. If you have a small or a very populated drive bay, it will be difficult to access those connectors, and if you have the angled SATA connectors, you will not be able to connect two drives in this bay, at least one drive will need a straight SATA connector.

Oh, and they are all in serious need of some quality editing. The poor editing just made the stories even worse. The potential is there for a good action packed sci fi romance but I think the author needs to write adult women into the roles not teen girls...and they're crappy teen girls at that. I've given this author 3 tries, I won't read anything from her again.",150,11,0,8

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,1,"I typically read the negative reviews before I buy something.  This review primarily addresses some of the negative reviews.  I've owned a black one for about 18 months and it is by far my favorite light weight jacket.  I have a camel color on order.  Some say it's larger than what the size label says...  Well, one needs to realize it is a ""golf"" jacket.  Hence, it is extra roomy in just the right areas for a golfer to take a full swing and not feel inhibited.  The medium I own fits like a medium should in the jacket and arm lengths, and the shoulder seams are exactly where they should be.  I have worn this jacket with a polo shirt and it's roomy, but fine.  I've also worn it with two layers of tee shirts and a sweatshirt, and went golfing...  It was great!  Regarding quality issues...  I have worn this jacket at least 250 days over the past 18 months and it shows no signs of wear.  I owned a London Fog overcoat many years ago, and the pocket stitching started unraveling after about 1 year; I sent it to London Fog (I paid for shipping) and they sent me a new overcoat (they paid for shipping).  Three inside pockets...  one on each breast and a lower one for a cell phone.  I've carried a Kindle in one breast pocket, a 7 inch tablet in the other breast pocket (both with protective cases) and my cell phone in the lower inside pocket, and keys and other miscellaneous things in the outside pockets.  I was weighed down a bit, but it worked great, particularly if one is traveling in a foreign country (very secure).",285,18,1,16

Home_and_Kitchen_5,3.0,1,"I've owned many-a steam mops in my day, and while this is a great mop that heats up quickly and offers a bunch of nice features, I wouldn't pay the hundred and forty dollars they're asking for this. There are just too many other, cheaper models out there that get your floors just as clean.

Now, if you're someone who sees yourself using the detachable handheld all the time, then this may be the steam mop for you. I THOUGHT I would use it all the time, but in reality I only used it once...the first day I got it.

The machine is light and easy to use while you're actually using it, but if you need to set it down, it's prone to tipping over due to it's shape.  The tank seems to go through water faster than other mops I've used, but maybe that's just me. Or maybe the steam gets hotter than other mops I've used, so it goes through water quicker? I don't know, but I do know I have to fill the tank three times to get all the hardwood/tile/stone in my house done.

Overall, would I recommend this mop? Absolutely. I just don't think it's necessary for the amount of money it costs (unless you really want that detachable steamer). There are plenty of high-quality steam-mops out there for much cheaper.",227,13,0,16

Books_5,1.0,1,"Why, oh why, do I keep on reading these! I have to chalk it up to sentiment, and perhaps the slim hope that a new ghostwriter will revive this once-charming series.

Simply put, this is a mess. There is the usual check-in with the mob of Pickax residents from earlier books, most of whom make brief and baffling appearances with little or no relation to the plot. The residents of this decidedly odd town - 400 miles north of reality - show up in droves for bookstore openings, stultifyingly dull lectures and amateur theatricals. (Thank god they seem to have given up eating pasties at every opportunity.)

The cats are little more than furniture these days, with Yum Yum barely making an appearance. Polly now manages a bookstore, but remains her snobby, charmless self. Qwill seems to have become the town errand boy, and, of course, pounds his mustache to a fare-thee-well.

The plot? It almost looked as though there would be one this time. But the reader is drawn in, only to be cruelly disappointed by an ending that lacks, well... an ending.

Go back and read the first three or four in the series, especially before Qwill moved to Pickax. They were certainly light reading, but the plots were intriguing, the writing was tighter and the books then deserved their Best Seller status.",225,16,1,2

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,1,"I have purchased six different brands, and models of 24 cup mini muffin pans.  I can't begin to tell you how many differences there are from pan to pan.

The reason I prefer this pan over others is that I bake mini brownies, cupcakes, carrot cakes and 'mini bite"" pastries of all kinds.  I use the fluted paper baking cups that measure 1-1/2"" X 1""
deep.  I use Reynolds brand, FC150x350 paper baking cups. the box says 3-1/2"" fluted cups, but that's the measurement before the cups are formed at the factory. *** Since the cups of this pan are only 3/4"" deep it allows the cakes and brownies to slightly ""flair out"" at the top; making them look larger than the ones made in deeper pans with the same 2"" diameter at the top.

I baked the identical pastries (half made in this pan, and others that were baked in the pans that were !"" deep). I offered them on trays set side by side, telling customers that they were ""IDENTICAL IN WEIGHT AND VOLUME"". Not one customer chose the pastries that were baked in the deeper pans. When you look at the finished product; made in this pan, it ""LOOKS"" and IS larger at the top!

I LOVE this pan, above any of the others and ""HIGHLY RECOMMEND"" it! The non-stick surface is outstanding too.

The Commercial II non-stick 24 cup mini- muffin pan measures 15-3/4"" by II""; each muffin measures 2"" in diameter and 3/4"" deep.

It's a little sweeter than the other two. The sex is still explicit and fairly frequent but just the overall tone was sweeter for me, in a good way, than the other two. Mack and Hud still have some sarcasm that go back and forth but Hud is just such a sweet guy. Hud has been playing football for 10 years and so is more mature and is ready for something else in his personal life. I loved Hud and Macks interactions together and the building of their relationship. It was genuine and believable for me. Nothing was rushed or forced. I was able to just dive in and stay there until I reached the end. In this book, Hud's football has reached the playoffs and so they are dealing with their relationship, who they are to the team, and the extra pressure from wanting to win the championship. I loved how the football and romance were mixed together. It was a great blend and I felt like I got enough of both, rather than feeling like I was missing something somewhere. I really enjoyed the characters and this story.

Jamie is a special type of witches breed and her power is coveted by more dangerous, powerful beings who kill anyone who gets in their way. Tiger-shifter Aiden Shrader is one of the Watchmen assigned to them, and an instant attraction develops between Olivia and him. Forced to drive a long distance trip to safety, they can't help being around each other, nor stop the desire flaming.

Aiden was raised by a horrid man who sexually abused him. Finally able to get away, he doesn't consider himself worthy of any woman, especially a human one. Yet, he will go to any lengths to protect Olivia, even die for her if he has to. Hot on their heels are the bad demons and undeadlies. Can Aiden and his fellow Watchmen stop them from capturing or hurting Olivia and Jamie? Will Aiden be able to hide his tiger-shifter powers from being exposed to Olivia and thus, frightening her? Or does the thought of unleashing the cat underneath his skin make her purr?

A thrilling, sensual story that will have you on the edge of your seat with nonstop action, I enjoyed every minute of Touch of Seduction by Rhyannon Bryd.

Kindle_Store_5,5.0,1,"I've read a lot of new adult romance books lately, so I've seen how a lot of them are the same, or how they differ.  I think anyone who reads a lot will kind of fall into that trap sometimes.  We always want something similar, but... not too much, you know?  To recapture that feeling that we had while reading something else, but to get a sense of more and a feeling of excitement, too.

This book is definitely that.  Right from the start, the entire thing catches you.  I honestly didn't expect what I was reading, but I liked it.  Caught and roped in, basically, and I wanted more.

Hopelessly Broken definitely provides more, too.  There's a lot going on in this book.  The characters are interesting and realistic.  I really enjoyed reading about Aeron especially.  I don't know that I've seen any character quite like him in another book.  Jenn's struggles are oftentimes something I think a lot of us can relate to, also.  Maybe not exactly, but the ideas and concepts behind them, you know?  I don't want to give too much away, but for a book like this to be as realistic was it was, I was impressed with how Tawny Taylor went about it.

One warning is that there's apparently another one planned for the future, so you're definitely going to want to keep an eye out for that.  Hopelessly Broken is on the longer side, though, so it's definitely really satisfying on its own.  I can't wait to read the second part!",258,20,1,17

Kindle_Store_5,4.0,1,"This review is also posted on my blog: theshortreviewer.blogspot.com

I normally enjoy stories that are told through the viewpoint of someone you can feel for--you know, a good guy or girl. Being that I knew this story would be told through the eyes of someone truly evil, then I got past that and found myself both intrigued and utterly disgusted at the same time. I do like a good disturbing thriller after all. And this book certainly delivered on that.

Fearlessly written, the author holds absolutely nothing back. This is not an exaggeration. The main character is a serial killer, and you are taken into his sick and twisted mind. The repetitiveness of his thoughts is indicative of how I believe someone like him would think. I had no empathy for this character at all. I found myself hoping this was fiction and not an autobiography in disguise! That is how good of a job the author does with bringing you inside this psycho's demented world.

The story is graphic, and many of the scenes are deeply horrifying and troubling. And what is even more terrifying is that there are people out there who do commit atrocious crimes such as this. So even though this is fiction, it is probably more realistic than most of us would like to believe.

It often read more like a diary, where the killer tells a lot of his story, and the dialogue is limited. It was a short, quick read, and I do sincerely hope for a sequel. The story did not feel finished as there is definitely more to be told here.

I recommend this for anyone who thinks they can take it for what it is - a messed up and gritty story.",292,21,1,11

My grandson had a ball with it while waiting to have his tonsils out.  HE wasn't interested in playing by the rules (he's 3), but he liked putting the discs in and then getting them to drop out.  When he got tired of doing that, he turned the discs into pretend food to use with the kitchen set.

The downside to this is I have had to pick up all of the discs many times as the 3 year olds (he has a twin brother) scatter them every where.  Oh well, that's what kids do.  We are working on getting them to help pick them up.  At least there is a convenient way to store them.",195,12,1,8

Electronics_5,5.0,1,"***UPDATE: December 10th, 2016 - Now that the price dropped to $260, plus $20 rebate, I take back everything I said about the RX 480. Because now, you're essentially paying the same price, for up to 50% more power. The compromise is the increased power draw and electricity bill, but if you're a PC gamer, you don't really care about it too much. Performance is the ultimate goal, and this card delivers in spades. It is the perfect balance of price/performance - $150 cheaper than a GTX 1070, for about 80-90% of the performance. That's amazing.

**UPDATE: August 6th, 2016 - What's even more amazing is that as of right now Amazon is only selling it for $310!**

This is amazing deal, compared to what the other R9 Fury's that are selling on Amazon. It's a little too little, a little too late, as the RX 480's and the the GTX 1060's are already here, with a better price per performance ratio. In a sandbox, an R9 Fury for $350 is a great deal, so that's why I'm giving it give stars. But in the real world, you would be better off to get two Rx 480 4GB's, and only pay $50 more for about 1.5x the performance.

The plastic parts are solid and the plastic part looks great. The metal part is well made and looks good on my rifle. I would recommend this to anyone.I bought this to replace the one I had installed on my M&P Shield.  It has great features and is great for shooting at range.  The only reason I gave it 5 stars is because it was very easy to install.  The included clip does not fit on the case.  This is a bad design and should be fixed.  The next time I shoot, I'll get another one of these for my Shield.  The belt does not come with the clip.  I had to go to the store to get the clip.  I was going to buy a second one for my Shield, but that was not a deal breaker.  It is good for a little practice but not a great purchase.  The clip is not flexible enough to handle the recoil of a gun.  The metal part is very easy to install and the clip is easy to install and remove.  I would recommend this to anyone who is considering this purchase.I like this because it's a little small for a small back pack, but it's perfect for a long day hike.

Electronics_5,4.0,1,"Let me say up front that I bought the 76cs almost exclusively for marine navigation. It is a great little GPS for that purpose and I'm sure it's equally good for hiking. There are a lot better choices for auto navigation but I'm totally happy with it for my purpose. I was initially quite skeptical that a handheld's small screen real estate could be useful as a chart plotter. Nonetheless, I purchased and installed the Blue Chart Americas CD and activated the Caribbean charts. After 2 weeks of constant use sailing in the Windward Islands, I'm astounded at how well it works. With the 'declutter' mode engaged, the screens show an appropriate level of detail and the display has excellent visibility in direct sun. Although the backlight is adequate for viewing in bright conditions under a boat's bimini, I found that I actually preferred to hold it out in the direct sunlight. I particularly like the ability to customize the paging sequence and the autozoom feature is handy as well. There is nothing intuitive about the interface but after I got over the learning curve, I was surprised how quickly I could get to the info I needed. Entering lat/lon waypoints is never going to be fun without a keyboard, but is certainly manageable. If you plan ahead, you can enter them on a PC and download them. A storage card slot would be nice but the entire Caribbean chart set used less than 1/4 of the available memory and on the plus side the unit really is waterproof. The battery life is about as advertised and you can really stretch it by turning it off and on as you need it because it gets a fix in about 15 seconds if you haven't moved too far.",297,14,0,15

Electronics_5,4.0,1,"First, let me say the obvious; for $100 this isn't cutting edge electronics so temper your expectations accordingly.  Having said that, this is a nice little tablet for the price as long as you keep it simple.

PROS:
Crisp display and at 7"" a nice viewing area.  Steams movies well with very minimal issues.
Comes with quite a few bells and whistles (so-so camera, assortment of apps, and some nice features such as weather updates and news)
Great for reading newspapers, books, and surfing non-graphic intensive web pages.

CONS:
Virtually no storage area, buying an expansion card is almost a must
Not powerful enough to play any graphic intensive apps.  Tried playing a simple app like Simpsons Tapped Out and it's very choppy and stutters.
Not a fan of the button placement but getting used to it.

Movies_and_TV_5,4.0,1,"I prefer realism over Hollywood story telling.  This film is a great ""Popcorn"" type of War Movie, that in a way reminds me of the old 40's war movies.  The plot centers around a tank crew led by Brad Pitt's character ""WarDaddy""  (right away, when I see a War film with the characters all having nicknames, I know I am in for less than realism and more Hollywoodism).

There's a lot to like about this film.  It is entertaining, the sound effects are awesome (LOVE LOVE LOVE the .50 cal firing), there's suspense, tension, and afront to innocence brought into a combat scenario.

The tactics, movement, command and control structure, and even discipline are all Hollywood screen writers (by that I mean, they are not realistic, but written for the screen to be entertaining).  The combat is intense, although a bit too contrived.  I think actual combat would've seen the engagements they depict not turn out as depicted.

Still, I feel this film is worthy of 4 stars (the only reason I didn't go 5 is because of the realism factor)... I don't feel at all like I wasted my money.

I haven't addressed a story synopsis or plot lines because, to be quite honest, I don't want to spoil your viewing (if you've not seen it), and if you have, you know those speak for themselves.

I highly recommend this film if you're looking for a really really good war film that will keep you on the edge of your seat.  Just don't expect the same level of immersion as other films, such as Platoon, or Saving Pvt. Ryan...  I don't think that was the filmakers' aim in making this.",281,16,0,16

Electronics_5,4.0,1,"Having used an Apple wireless mini keyboard with a Macbook Pro at my former job, I wanted to find something similar to use with the Dell laptop provided by my new employer. A full sized keyboard takes up too much desk space, and I had gotten used to the mini layout. This was the most similar product I could find.

I've been using this keyboard and mouse for a few days now and have no real complaint. The layout is familiar, so I'm not fatfingering things. The mouse is comfortable and responsive - pretty much the same size and shape as the compact Logitech mouse I use with my home system.

Good things:

- Keyboard and mouse are both solid and well made
- They both *look* solid and well made - attractive design and finish
- They both work as they should, and well

Not so good things (and this is a fairly subjective list):

- Keyboard is a bit loud and clicky for my taste
- Took a bit of time to figure out why they keys did not appear mapped to the right characters - the num lock was on. This may be a problem with my laptop, and not the keyboard
- I wish the mouse had rubbery sides
- I wish the keyboard had a power switch

Amazon even sells a device to bolt onto the gun to mitigate 'barrel-droop' so this must be a real issue. Reviews of other manufacturers' guns do not mention 'barrel-droop' so I can only conclude that RWS has an issue other manufacturers do not.

But if this is such a great gun, why does one have to purchase an extra device to mitigate what appears to me to be either a design issue or a manufacturing defect?  I would love to hear a real explanation from an expert.  Until then, I will postpone any purchase decision.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,1,"Lately I have been trying to put together affordable every day (EDC) pen lights among some other stronger lumen tactical lights for other applications. I recently bought the Milwaukee pen light and this Coast pen light to compare. This Coast Pen Light is definitely a focused light, just like its advertised, a focused light for closer ranges, because your beam makes a perfect circle, a perfect circumference, and the closer the object is the more intense the light is. The further you shine your light out, the bigger your circle gets and the weaker that intensity is; whereas with the Milwaukee pen light get a consistent brighter light no matter how far you shine it and you get a wider area of coverage. I can shine up my backyard pretty good with the Milwaukee light than the Coast Pen Light thats for sure.
Im glad I bought both lights to test out how I would use them when I needed too. They are both affordable and both are good lights, but out of the two, I would carry the Milwaukee everyday and leave my Coast light by my nightstand. To me, that is where the Coast Pen Light would come in handier, when you need to find something closer to you near in the dark. Now I am going to save up and purchase a bit more expensive rechargeable Streamlight Pen Light.
Another recommendation I would make is to invest in some really good rechargeable batteries, like the Panasonic Eneloop Pros and get yourself a smart charger as well, where you can make setting adjustment for your batteries and tests your batteries.",272,10,0,13

Joan Collins is head of a group pushing an island paradise resort - yet to be built - and Lancing is the pilot of the boat that brings in the latest boatload of suckers....I mean investors...to view the imaginary golf course and club house.  Only problem, refugees from THEM! are lurking in the woods making off with islanders and soon to investors of Joan's resort.  The effects are typical Drive-in B movie quality (but hey, I miss the old drive-ins!! When I visited Kentucky they would have dusk to dawn creature features and that is where I first saw this movie), but Lancing as always is better than the material he is given and makes this worth the ticket.
So stack up four of five our your best Vincent Price and Chris Lee films, add Empire of the Ants (and watch the wonderful and well missed Robert Lancing), pop a bowl of popcorn , turn out the lights and imagine you are in a car with a speaker hanging from the window.

On top of that, in this second installment of The Enchanter, the hunters are attempting to wipe out an entire city's paranormal population; and Dorian recognizes the magic involved - you guessed it, family. The only way to stop it is to try and get the entire city to work together, but that is like herding cats, literally and figuratively, maybe.

Toys_and_Games_5,4.0,1,"My four-year-old daughter loves Disney Junior, and while she'll watch Miles from Tomorrowland, it's never been one of her favorites. As a result, this Photon Flyer was our first Miles toy. My daughter apparently recognized the craft from the show and immediately began to play with it.

Although the Miles figure glows and the wings light up, it's actually pretty basic for a toy vehicle these days.  The wings fold back a little for ""surface mode,"" and the nose of the craft can slightly extend for ""hyper speed mode,"" but that's about it. On the one hand, it opens a door for fun and imagination, but I think my youngest was a bit disappointed that it didn't at least make sounds.

Of course, this Photon Flyer works best when combined with other Miles toys that we do not have. It fits into a sold-separately toy called the Stellosphere, which -- according to the box -- ""amps up"" this toy with sounds, more lights, and larger wings. So at the moment, our vehicle is not ""amped up,"" nor do we have accessories (none included) to store in the ship's cute cargo hold. Although my daughter creatively put some Lion Guard stuff in there and promptly added Lion Guard figures to her Miles missions. And finally, the box prominently shows the Merc figure (not included) who has his own custom seat and moon roof in the flyer.

All in all, if you have other Miles toys already, this Photon Flyer is a great addition to any collection. It works great with other figures, accessories, and the Stellosphere set. If, like us, it's all on its own in the Miles universe, you'll likely be encouraged by your child to expand your collection... Unless they want to enlist other friends, like the Lion Guard, in their space adventures.",304,15,0,10

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,2.0,1,"I purchased this nailer after my Dewalt 18v finish nailer decided to take a vacation. I install doors for a living, and needed a nailer with enough stank behind it to countersink nails through 5/4 material. I almost purchased a new Dewalt but this Ryobi had decent reviews, a comparable warranty, but a much better price point. All of my hand tools are Ryobi so I had more than enough batteries/chargers on hand. My experience with Ryobi tools has been a positive one. I'm extremely rough on my equipment, and they have all held up to the beating. Anyway, this nailer is OK. If you're using it for the occasional project, and don't mind having a few floating nails, it'll do just fine. This nailer however, did not meet my expectations. Didn't matter if I was using 2 inch nails or 2 1/2....didn't matter if I was nailing into a low profile interior trim, or thicker 5/4 material...didn't matter if I had the depth as deep as it would go and the compression gauge all the way to max...didn't matter how I held the gun against the material...it just wouldn't countersink the nails consistently. Maybe 6/10 successful countersinking. That meant more time manually punching nails and filling holes. Another issue I was having was the constant ""skipping"" off the nail head causing basically 2 holes to puddy AND the nail head was not countersunk. That didn't happen too often, but it was enough to make me say aloud, ""what the???"" The price listed above is insane- I picked up mine at the Home Depot for $200. It's possible I just had a defective product, because all the other reviews I've read were glowing for this exact same product. It's possible it was defective, but it's possible the next one will be too- so I'm going to purchase the newer Senco F16. Same conveniences, still less than Dewalt, and looks like a space-gun.

Because it is a larger item to ship, the package was vacuum-sealed, but I had absolutely no problems getting it out and fluffing it to its full potential size. I love how the size and versatility of the pillow's opening allows you to be very flexible with your sleeping options. I am a side sleeper, so I simply adjust the other side of the pillow so that it is touching my back to create a very comfortable cocoon.

The absolute best thing about this pillow is that it stays very cool. I am in Southern California, where we occasionally see 75-80 degree weather in January, so I was very happy to find that this pillow is great at cooling and overall temperature regulation.

Books_5,5.0,1,"I heard the author in a workshop that he gave and it really whet my appetite to read the book and try out what he suggests.
I have read countless books on dating, trying to figure out what I have been doing  wrong, how/why I keeping picking/attracting the wrong partners, why there  has been so much resentment, conflict and bitterness in my past  relationships, etc.
After I read the book it all became crystal clear to  me.  I had been considering personality compatibility, but only in a  general way. Neither my partners nor I were ""bad"" people, we were  just the ""wrong"" people for each other.
Dr. Avila's book  enables you to ""type"" yourself, how to quickly size up others for  their ""type"" and my favorite features, WHERE to meet others of  your compatible type and HOW to attract and build relationships with them.  These techniques apply to BOTH opposite AND same sex friendships. Very  targeted, specific information, very rare in dating books.
I realize now  that by following the advice in other dating books, I was hanging out in  the wrong places to meet MY best type.
His theories sound rock solid both  from a psychological and common sense point of view.
I think that his  book settles once and for all the opposites attract, but do they stay  together debate.
Lastly, I commend Dr. Avila for going beyond the theory,  and putting the principles into practice by actually encouraging/helping  set up LoveType social groups. In fact, I am going to his book signing  tonight, to be followed by mingling and discussion of starting up a social  group in the Los Angeles area.  I'm REALLY looking forward to what might  come of it!

Kindle_Store_5,4.0,1,"Elsa Quinn has been bullied her whole life, not just the kids at school but her mothers constant harping on weight loss has finally reached a boiling point.  Deciding to take matters into her own hands, Elsa joins a gym preparing to exercise the weight off.

Noah Stewart drives to another town to workout, as a football jock at school he gets inundated with his friends wanting to hang out while at the gym and he just wants to focus on working out.  When he sees Elsa, he wants to know why she is there, sure he has seen her at school but he wonders if she will tell people he is here.  Elsa though surprises him and realizing she has no plan, he offers to help her out.  At first Elsa questions Noah's intentions but realizes he has never been part of the bullying she accepts.  Noah doesn't plan on falling for Elsa though and he does, Elsa though is afraid of what going public will do.

I liked this a lot.  Noah's view on why Elsa is trying to lose weight is not what you would think.  Elsa is vulnerable, her mother is a class act and I can understand Elsa's choices.  Great read.",206,11,0,2

Movies_and_TV_5,2.0,1,"The best thing about this DVD: a chance to be introduced to some of most wonderful music beyond the standard repertory.  As someone forever seeking something I haven't heard before, this score was something of a revelation.  And this is greatly to the credit of William Christie, and his superb group of singers (Piau, Naouri, d'Oustrac, Piolino, Lehtipuu) who were fully engaged and demonstrated that there is much fine singing beyond the Three Tenors world.

However: the staging is just soooo tiresome!  It starts off amusingly with white projections that end up built up like a three tier cake with dancers and singers coming and going through them.  Unfortunately then you realize that's all it's going to happen, with singers mainly in the forefront while all the dancing and projections are going on in the background non stop.  I'm sure in the theater this might have been very distracting.  On video at least the camera can focus mainly on the singers and ignore most of the extraneous business during their arias.

If you curious of the music you should seriously explore the music on CDs; however if this is your only option, view a borrowed copy to make sure you know what you're getting.  It ain't cheap.  Were it not for the wonderful music, I would have tossed it out long ago.",222,11,1,3

It takes clear pictures and video, has withstood my dropping it, and does a good job of focusing on faces.

Two negatives: first, the lag between photos can be unbearable, particularly when the flash has been discharged. I tried taking pictures in a theatre and had to wait literally about 30 seconds in between shots... which is terrible when you're trying to capture something as it's happening! When I loaned the camera to someone, she told me, ""I'd return it if I were you. I have no idea how you stand that.""

Thing is, I love just about everything else about it. If I had the money, I'd buy a different camera to use indoors and keep this one for the outdoors/good lighting shots.

The other negative is that it really isn't great with red eyes. My whole family is prone to red eyes, and haven't yet found a camera that reliably fixes that problem.

Do not get this as your first helo. You need to know how to fly a V911 or V912 size first. This could seriously damage something (or someone) in your yard. Also, while this helo can take a reasonable beating, you'll damage it pretty quick if you don't know how to fly it. Heavier weight equals more damage.

Pet_Supplies_5,4.0,1,"My plecostomus devour these (API) algae wafers in no time flat. They apparently love the taste. I feed them these daily and occasionally give them some fresh zucchini. I like that the wafers settle on the bottom of the tank quickly and dissolve easily. However, they do cloud the water a bit, but that is to be expected especially if you have any light, natural or artificial, since light grows algae. My tank sits near a window, so it does get some natural sun, so a little algae is inevitable and doesnt really bother me. I just embrace the fact that sometimes the water doesnt look clean. And finally, these wafers aren't terribly expensive, they will run you a little over $6 for a 3.7 oz container.

The handles are see through plastic with a nice hole for hanging.  The brush has a white handle and the silicone bristles are blue.  The brush head removes for easy cleaning and is very durable and works great at spreading the BBQ sauce.  I have used other silicone brushes before but they did not come apart and they would get built up discoloration or food particles where the head connected to the handle.  The brush head stays on very well during use also.  The spatulas are all well attached and no matter how hard I pulled them they did not loosen or pull off the handles.  I have had so many of the rubber or silicone spatulas pull off and its so aggravating.  They handles are large and sturdy and very easy to grasp and use.  They are easy to clean and I just throw my in my dishwasher. My favorite feature is unlike the rubber spatulas these don't stain or at least mine have not yet and I use them daily. My set came with a small spatula that measures 9 inches long and the spatula head is 2 3/4 long and 1 3/8 wide.  The medium spatula and spoon are 10 inches long and measure 3 1/4 long and around 2 1/2 inches wide. Perfect for your everyday cooking or baking needs.

Movies_and_TV_5,4.0,1,"""Tonight or Never"" is one of the ten best movies about opera ever made (There have been at least 10, right?  There is ""A Night at the Opera"" and ""The Great Caruso,"" and they go to an opera in ""Pretty Woman. ""  Does that count?). Gloria Swanson plays Nella Vago, a young singer who has a rather disappointing operatic debut in Venice. Her voice teacher, Rudig (Gerdinand Gottschalk), tell here that her voice lacks warmth and feeling. Meanwhile, a young man (Melyvn Douglas) is following her around everything. Nella returns home to Budapest, where she learns that a scout from the Metropolitan Opera has refused to sign her until she can truly feel her songs. Depressed, she goes to the apartment of the young man and makes love to him. The next night Nella stuns the audience with her emotional performance in ""Tosca. ""  But now she has to choose between a career and the man she loves (apparently having both does not occur to her). Swanson is pretty good in this early talkie, especially since she is dressed up in stunning gowns by Coco Chanel, which may well be the best part of the movie. This 1931 film directed by Mervyn LeRoy was based on the play by Lili Hatvany and this would be a much better movie if it seemed less like a play. Two other interesting tidbits about ""Tonight or Never"": The cameraman was Gregg Toland, the famous cinematographer who worked with Orson Welles on ""Citizen Kane"" and the scene stealing waiter was Boris Karloff, in his first role after ""Frankenstein.",264,14,0,0

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,4.0,1,"Brand new, the Spaulding 64-497 Official NBA Zi/O Excel indoor/outdoor basketball looks slick, and feels great in your hands.  The synthetic leather is very tacky, allowing someone with a medium sized hand, to palm the ball.  Along with a nice grip, the foam backing underneath gives the ball a cushiony feel, allowing for excellent control when dribbling.  This ball would be a very terrific choice for indoors , as the cushioning seems to make for a ball that is very responsive and lively.

With a softer outer layer, this ball doesnt fare quite as well outdoors.  Depending on the type of playing surface (concrete, asphalt), the ball can be a little less lively when dribbling.  Being sticky, it attracts dirt, and dust, and soon loses its tacky feel.  And playing on a hoop that has a steel net, probably isn't very healthy for the composite surface.

In conclusion, the Zi/O ball feels great, and would be ideal on an indoor court.  It can certainly be used outdoors, it probably won't hold up very well long term, under the more rugged conditions.

Coincidentally? Stephen King's--The Stand--worked in an almost identical fashion with the first exposed dying within minutes and those secondarily exposed later taking a couple of days and then several days to die, while those who were immune were just immune.

I realize that no novel can tell everything, but there are a crucial two months missing, where a plague apparently swept the Earth and the ""Immari Imperium"" began. Finally, and for me the most vexing thing, is the fact that there are aliens beneath the Antarctic and we don't know a thing about them except that they built a device that transmits a virulent plague. When you engage in biological warfare, what you are after is extermination. Not a good omen when they are a vastly technologically superior visitor. Ask the Native Americans!",175,12,1,7
Books_5,5.0,1,"Laurel Hawthorne is a woman with secrets, which she believed she'd left behind when she married David and moved into a posh gated community. Until, that is, the night that their daughter's friend drowned in the Hawthornes' pool, a terrible event that put a huge crack in Laurel's carefully maintained facade. The Girl Who Stopped Swimming is a riveting, Southern gothic, family drama, driven by the skeletons in Laurel's closet, her fear for her own daughter, and her love-hate relationship with her glamorous older sister, Thalia. Did someone cause Mollie's drowning? Was it an accident or a murder? What does daughter Shelby know that she isn't telling? Does David have a mistress? Do ghosts really appear to Laurel? And, underlying all these foreboding questions is an even darker one, about a death that occurred during her childhood.

The Girl Who Stopped Swimming is a real page turner, from the first to the final chapters.",154,10,0,0
